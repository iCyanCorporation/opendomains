Public Policy Document
======================

#### [The Science, Technology and Innovation Policy](https://www.uaelegislation.gov.ae/en/policy/details/science-technology-and-innovation-policy)

### Introduction

The Science, Technology and Innovation Policy was issued in 2024. The policy represents a pivotal step in a series of developmental initiatives to achieve progress, economic diversification, prosperity, and leadership, primarily aiming to prepare for a post-oil world.

The policy will focus on several national projects in the fields of solar energy, hydrogen production and storage, health-related areas concerning cardiovascular disorders, metabolic diseases, cancer sciences, environmental areas related to fishing and aquaculture, sustainable food production technology, as well as sustainable desalination, water reuse, artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science, cybersecurity, industrial sectors regarding 3D printing, and smart materials.

### Policy Objectives

1. Drive economic growth through knowledge-based industries and solutions built on science and technology to enhance the state's competitiveness.
2. Direct research and development to address key national challenges and develop solutions for utilization across various sectors.
3. Establish a rich base of diverse scientific and research competencies as a cornerstone for the growth of the research and development ecosystem, supporting the national economy and enhancing its competitiveness.
4. Foster research collaboration in science and technology across sectors, both domestically and internationally.

### Priorities & Key Components

**Energy Transition:**

1. **Solar Energy:**
   * Most suitable source of renewable energy given the environmental conditions in the UAE.
   * Existing projects and infrastructure availability.
2. **Hydrogen Production and Storage:**
   * High economic potential and availability of local and global partners.
   * Long-term commercial potential through technology export and hydrogen production.
3. **Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage:**
   * Leading global oil and gas companies in the UAE capable of pioneering in this field.
   * High dependence on the oil and gas sector.

**Health and Human Prosperity:**

1. **Cardiovascular Disorders and Metabolic Syndrome:**
   * Alignment with efforts to reduce the burden of prevalent diseases in the region.
   * Increased scientific knowledge base regarding the causes of high rates of cardiovascular disorders and metabolic syndrome.
2. **Cancer:**
   * Need to develop necessary capabilities in clinical trials for oncology.
   * Research needed to develop preventive measures alongside precision medicine and tailored treatments for UAE populations.
3. **Human Prosperity:**
   * High correlation between increased life expectancy and social-economic prosperity.
   * Need to find solutions that contribute to improving prevention or delaying age-related diseases and raising life expectancy in the UAE.

**Food Security:**

1. **Fishing and Aquaculture:**
   * Current reliance on natural fish stocks has reached maximum sustainable limits.
   * Need for a sustainable, carbon-neutral food production pattern.
2. **Sustainable Production Technologies:**
   * Necessity for sustainable production systems and technologies to ensure food security in the UAE.
   * Research and development in this area impacting various food sources in the country, such as agriculture, fishing, and aquaculture.
   * Lack of integrated agriculture and irrigation systems that can benefit from abundant seawater.

**Water Security:**

1. **Sustainable Desalination:**
   * Current water desalination operations consume significant energy.
   * Availability of leading research capabilities in the field.
2. **Water Reuse:**
   * Facilities for treating sewage water in the country.
   * Addressing increased demand for water while controlling pollution from sewage water and desalination by-products.
   * Limited available technologies for treating sewage water, especially for reuse in agriculture.

**Digital Technology and Cybersecurity:**
