Victoria Rey (she/her) is a queer storyteller and artist raised in Atlanta and Appalachia currently living in Brooklyn, NY. She is a “Bless your heart” sun, “If it was a snake it would’ve bit me” moon, and an “It’s not the heat, it’s the humidity” rising.

Victoria is the founder of Queer Money Project, a community mapping project of queer-owned businesses in New York City (and soon, someday beyond NYC.) She writes what can best be described as a fair weather newsletter called my glass house and is currently working on "Hello from Grief Island," a zine about grief and family history.

She studied Music Composition and English Literature at Georgia State University and served two AmeriCorps terms at Providence CityArts for Youth in Providence, RI.
