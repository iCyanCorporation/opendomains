Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

* [How much time will it take for you to make my app?](#faq-list-1) 

  To give you a precise answer we must prepare a project scope and create a budget.
  We shall tell you how much of that scope can be completed within the budget and we'll be
  able to estimate how long will it take. Don't worry, if you're
  not happy with our work, you can retract from the project anytime with no penalties.
* [I want to be involved in the app development process, do you have a problem with that?](#faq-list-2)

  Not at all! We want you to be sure you'll receive the product you desire.
  From the planning stage to each finished version, we invite you to evaluate
  and improve our work. Our philosophy is to work with the client,
  not merely finish given tasks. We are always ready to listen and communicate.
* [What happens after you finish my app?](#faq-list-3) 

  Hopefully the app is exactly what you dreamed of.
  But apart from delivering a finished product, we are happy to provide you with technical support
  and app maintenance should you need it. After all, we know our work inside out.
  Of course if you want to maintain the app by yourself the source code and all technical data
  is at your disposal, but even in that case, feel free to contact us if you need any help.
* [Can the software be upgraded in the future as new technology becomes available?](#faq-list-4) 

  Of course! We are always happy to improve, upgrade and further develop our work.
* [How much do you charge?](#faq-list-5)

  It depends on many things: project scope, time spent on the project and technological issues.
  We know it sounds vague but its simply honest. Remember that each software project is different,
  especially if you had a particularly original idea. We do not want to give you an unrealistic
  estimate,
  instead we want to provide you with the best quality possible within your budget.
