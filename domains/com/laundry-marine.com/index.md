### Newbuilding

We offer a full support package in the development of laundry departments for new buildings and refit projects, including laundry layout, equipment specifications and project management.

Our unique difference is that we are starting with the operational concept, before we specify the laundry equipment and the design layout.

This operational laundry engineering approach should be the standard, but it isn’t.

The yard supplies a ship which contains a laundry space and the equipment supplier, supplies equipment. Both done within a ship design where architects don’t consider operational and technical laundry requirements. This combination ultimately leads always to the well-known phrase “The crew will find a way to manage it”.

We at Menker – Laundry Marine Consultants develop laundries from an operational perspective with a holistic operational approach to fulfill the operational needs, to be efficient, hygiene safe and sustainable.

The technical part is important, but it ultimately needs to fulfill the operational requirements, not the opposite as can still be found in some designs today.

### Operation

A laundry within the marine industry plays a major specific role onboard for all Guests and Crew alike. These needs to provide an efficient laundry require specific experience, thought, design and attention to details and be carefully considered, no longer should they be regarded as just a room back of house housing laundry equipment.

While the marine industry tries to minimize costs and make claims to their endeavor’s on improving environmental impact, it’s surprising that for some owners and operators the laundry’s remain untouched from an advanced operational and technical perspective.

Today, literally millions of owners and operator’s dollars continue to be wasted through inefficient laundry layouts and there operational set up. Owners and operators could make significant noticeable reductions of these wasted dollars with a more efficient and professional laundry operation with a holistic approach.

A big environmental factor decarbonization is the hot topic in how this can be reduced, the fact is the laundry is one of the biggest energy consumers onboard.

Have you ever reviewed if your laundry operation meets your linen care recommendations and how you can increase the linen life cycle?

### Environment

Don’t you find it a little unusual that you haven’t seen any development in your detergent product portfolio, while onshore laundries have made significant steps during the past decades?

We at Menker believe to seriously review these items you require an experienced expert in laundry, who is constantly looking into the latest technologies available and able to provide an independent review providing real opportunities in your interests and not from a supplier point of view.

Laundries on cruise ships are far away to be sustainable or efficient.

Read More

Wash extractors using 50% more water and energy compared to same equipment onshore, while tunnel washer systems still using 20% more water, energy and detergents.

Obviously it is not an advertised fact that the industry causes more than 1,000,000 p.a. empty plastic drums through their laundry operation, shows that things could be optimized.

While plastic straws and single used plastic are banned on most cruise ships, micro and nano plastic from laundry operation is still discharged to sea.

While onshore laundries have made substantial progress and advances during the past decades to reduce their environmental impact, many cruise ship laundries and ultimately their employees are also continuing to operate in the past.

The energy and water consumption as well CO2 impact is still the same, simplest measurements for decarbonization are not implemented.

If you have an interest to reduce the environmental impact of your laundries, something you can really shout about we at Menker would be delighted to support and assist you.

### Menker

### Certified Laundry Engineers

Menker, was founded as a commercial hotel laundry in the 1950’s, focusing today as an independent laundry consultant and expertise focused on the Cruise ship and marine industry.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With over 25 years background in the marine and Cruise ship industry, we are today a well-known, respected and most importantly a trusted partner and adviser of new and established Cruise ship owners, operators, and suppliers. Our working history and experience spans from the private luxury yachts sector to the largest Cruise ships that are currently in service today.

Today’s ship owners and operators are no longer willing to accept the previous ways of the Builder’s and supplier’s accept the previous ways of the Builder’s and supplier’s defining their operational needs and processes with little input by themselves. This is where Menker leads the field, with our experience of working hand in hand with Owners, and operators or fully representing them to ensure all of their needs are absorbed into the specification, design and installation.

### Why Choose ...?

Menker Laundry Marine Consultants
---------------------------------

It’s time, because newbuilding and refit laundry projects are based since decades on the same approach, defined by yards and suppliers. We are still seeing technical and operational set ups on newbuilding’s, which are totally obsolete and usually not used any more on shore since years.

Our evaluation & audits on board pointing always the same topics. The interesting thing is, that still after we have provided our reports, operator executives trust on supplier statements like “it doesn’t work on Cruise ships”. But in truth, our recommendations have already been implemented, concepts are working, leads to a higher efficiency and reduction of the environmental impact.

The challenge is, to convince suppliers to change their sales philosophy to a more service orientated approach.

Operators should clearly specify their own needs and expectations for an holistic laundry approach and suppliers should to be guided to follow this defined concept.

Neither yards nor suppliers have the holistic required technical and operational laundry background to set up laundries or to optimize the operation, as they are focused on their own specific technical areas.

You as operator are the only part in such projects, with an interest in an efficient, hygiene safe and sustainable laundry. Only you as operator have to pay finally the daily laundry bill.

If you want to have a well working and efficient on board laundry, you need an own professional educated and experienced in-house laundry expert, or Menker Laundry Marine Consultants, as a full or part time supporting part of your technical and hotel operations teams.

So, finally the question is not why to choose Menker Laundry Marine Consultants. The question is, do you want to keep the status quo of inefficient cruise ship laundries, or do you want to improve and professionalize your laundries in general to meet and exceed your targets?
