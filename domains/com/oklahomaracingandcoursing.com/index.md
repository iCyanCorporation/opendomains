About ORCA
----------

ORCA (Oklahoma Racing and Coursing Association) is a sighthound club located in the beautiful countryside, outside of Vinita Oklahoma. Founded in 2014, the founding members combined have 20 - 40 years of experience in all types of sighthound events. In the beginning, ORCA offered CWA (Continental Whippet Association) racing, LGRA (Large Gazehound Racing Association) racing, and AKC Lure Coursing. Over the years, ORCA has added AKC CAT and AKC FCAT to their events for all breeds to enjoy. In 2024 we added ASFA. We are dedicated to providing safe and fun events for both hounds and their owners to participate in. In future years, other types of events are being considered. **Be sure to stop by our Events page to check out our upcoming events.**
