#### About Me, Rayanne Rodier I recently completed the Professional Editing Certificate program at Mount Royal University (MRU).  I am an avid reader and audible listener. I have studied to become an editor to help authors develop their stories and prepare them for publication. I can assist with developmental and stylistic editing, copyediting and proofreading.

#### ​I am currently working on my own novel and a children's book series. I have shared excerpts under my portfolio section, depicting my original writing and the editing I have done as part of the program at Mount Royal University.
