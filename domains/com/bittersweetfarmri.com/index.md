Welcome to Bittersweet Farm Estate  
  
Nestled within the heart of East Greenwich, Rhode Island, is the 22-acre Bittersweet Farm Estate. The farm offers a magical and peaceful atmosphere with its charming stone walls, idyllic wildflower gardens, and friendly animals grazing in the meadows. As you make your way down the driveway, you’ll be welcomed by the stunning original farm buildings, architecture that tells a story. The main manor house, a quaint cottage, an elegant potting shed, a saloon-style barn, a creative studio, stables, and a large rustic-luxe event barn all blend seamlessly with the natural surroundings. Bittersweet Farm Estate has a rich heritage and pastoral setting make it an ideal location for weddings, corporate events, and special occasions.

*Bittersweet Farm Estate is a private residence;   
visits are by appointment only.*
