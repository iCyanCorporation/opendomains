General Manager
---------------

Tommy Marks
-----------

I began my career at Jakers Bar and Grill in Pocatello as a host when I was 16 years old. Aside from a short stint in serving, my path at Jakers consisted mostly of cooking, bookkeeping and managing, until I was promoted to Assistant General Manager. I later segued into the role of Kitchen Manager, a period of time that was very rewarding and during which I learned a great deal.

I was ultimately promoted to General Manager in Pocatello, and shortly thereafter I was transferred to General Manager here in Twin Falls. It was a move that I have been very happy with, as I truly enjoy the people here, both coworkers and clientele.

I plan to give my best to this restaurant and community, and I will keep my goals set on ensuring the best possible experience for our guests. I have thoroughly enjoyed my career at Jakers, and am looking forward to the years to come.

"We love Jakers. The food is always delicious, fresh, and of good quality. The staff is friendly and more than happy to make an order exactly what you want it to be. Their lunch soup and salad bar is the best in town."

R Mikhael Presher

"The service is top-notch, and the food is excellent. I had their special baked potato, scones (they're not buns!) which were served with tasty honey butter, and the 6oz sirloin cooked to perfection."

Carel Neffenger

"Oh my goodness. I post a lot of positive reviews because I'm usually pretty happy with places, but Jakers deserves extra stars beyond the 5 I can give it. For my money, this might be the best restaurant in Twin Falls."

Kevin Wessman

"Food was great! We had the Brussel sprout appetizer, steak, tuna salad, and a burger. Everything we had was good. Our server Dakota was a pleasure. If we lived in the area, we'd certainly return."

JB Boling

"We are working in Jerome and drive to Twin Falls when we want a great meal at Jakers. We are never disappointed. The service is always with a smile. My husband's steak was cooked perfectly! Looking forward to our next visit!"

Penelope Cyr-Lorenson

"Went on a Saturday night with 3 adults and 3 kids under 12. Seating was quick, server was there when we needed and checked on us regularly. The food was on point! Absolutely delicious and the steaks were cooked perfectly."
