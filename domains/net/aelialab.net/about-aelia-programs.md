Our Leadership & Talent Development Programs

##### Boosting your People's potential

Both in the Leadership as well as in the Talent Development programs we empower professionals to activate and develop their innate potential. We define a development journey for the beneficiaries and assist them, along the way, with our guidance to discover their potential, to tackle the challenges which they face to work on their weaknesses and to make the most of their skills.

Both types of programs are multiple-hour\* programs, with an "on-the-job" development approach, where guided projects are the key, consultations are the backbone and gamified challenges activate, challenge and empower.

### How our Programs are designed & delivered

Program Design

### Our programs and services are designed by our dedicated L&D Design Team, composed of individuals with a deep passion for People Development. Each team member brings over a decade of experience in education, learning, human resources development, and educational technologies.​

Design Review

Every program undergoes a thorough review by the AELIA Board of Administration. This board comprises seasoned professionals from six distinct fields: finance, technology, education, marketing & communication, law, economics, and business management.

Program Delivery

AELIA’s L&D programs are delivered by a team of 12 L&D Instructors, including facilitators, adult trainers, and mentors. These instructors come from diverse professional backgrounds but share a common talent and dedication to people development and adult training, which they channel into their work at AELIA. With distinct professional careers across seven industries, they bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to our organization. Notably, eight of them are business executives or entrepreneurs with proven business acumen.
