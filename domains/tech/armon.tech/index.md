Projects
========

### This website!

Developer

Made this website in Next.js 15, mainly as a way of practicing front-end. Meant to act as a portfolio page, but I might also add blog posts or other features down the line.

### Music

Amateur creator

Calling myself a "music producer" would be wildly overselling, that's why I've written amateur creator instead! Spurred by sporadic bursts of inspiration, I keep coming back to this hobby(✿◡‿◡)

Skills
------

### Kubernetes

Really enjoy working with k8s:) Mostly only through certifications and local cluster until now.

### Docker

Can't do kubernetes without Docker! Experienced enough for basic usage.

### Linux

OS of choice for programming. Period. Pretty good at day-to-day use, but I also know some basic bash scripting, network config, and sysadmin work.

### Python

One of my main programming languages. Lets just say I really enjoy Python.
