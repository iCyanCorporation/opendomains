WHO WE ARE?
-----------

*Welcome to our compassionate online retail haven, where we bring you a collection of thoughtful products designed to enhance the challenging lives of Special Needs individuals, Senior Citizens, people with Dementia and Alzheimer's. Our aim is simple: to provide innovative solutions that foster cognitive engagement, support physical well-being, and contribute to emotional stability.*

*Sheddys is a small, family-owned business. We love designing convenient and thoughtful products that you can use in your daily life. These elderly assistance products are an effort to do just that. We hope you love our elderly care products as much as we do.*

*Thanks for supporting our family business.*

* Our Vision

  At Sheddys, we believe that as a family, we can make a difference with what God has given usâ€”our time, talents, and resources. Our company was inspired by our son, Sheddy, who is our miracle baby. We believe he was given to us for a special purpose, which is why we named our company after him.
* Our Mission

  Our goal is to support mission churches, especially to improve the learning environment for children in Sunday schools. As a teacher, I love seeing kids' faces light up when they learn something new, but many of these children are learning in difficult conditions. We want to help change that.
* Our Products

  *Our meticulously chosen range of items is thoughtfully crafted to cater to the unique needs of our cherished customers. From sensory stimulation tools to adaptive learning aids, our store is dedicated to providing valuable resources that empower both caregivers and those in need, fostering an environment of inclusivity and understanding.*
