Garrett and team did a fantastic job in milling, finishing, and providing install oversight for my 1966 Chevy truck bed wood. He cut and planed rough cut cherry wood to size. He created the needed chamfer steps for retention strips. Finished with a marine grade UV coating. Garrett was on sight during the install to provide technical assistance for a great install. I wood highly recommend Kirwin Wood Co. and Garrett for any and all custom wood projects.

I love my new cutting board!

We have loved everything from Kirwin Wood Co. Everything Garrett makes is high quality and a beautiful combination of design and function. I had a broken wood-slat cutting board that has been in our family for multiple generations, and Garrett was able to repair and refinish it! Highly recommend üòä

Garrett was so easy and accommodating to work with. He gave me 3 estimates and let me choose the one which worked within my budget. Then he offered me several choices of stains, came to my house for matching ideas, and installed the final quickly.

I commissioned this lovely little holder for an even littler chicken for a friend and it did not disappoint. It was actually above and beyond what I asked for and the friend absolutely adores it!

Garrett is amazing! He takes tons of pride in his work to deliver the best product he can. He is super easy to communicate with and extremely reliable! Give him a call for any of your needs!

Beautifully crafted!
Our daughter loves the handcrafted baby doll cradle. And our son is a huge fan of the rubber band gun. You can tell both items were made with care and attention to detail. The wood is both smooth and sturdy and will last for a really long time. If you‚Äôre looking for a high quality item, Kirwin Wood Co is the place to go!
