Modern farmhouse with clean, crisp lines, large, bright sunny windows! This is the in-town Driggs home you don't want to miss! Dark, solid surface stone counter tops & farm sink provide the perfect contrast to the sparkling Zellige tile backsplash, gleaming cabinetry, and stainless appliances, including an induction range. Forced hot water heat is the heart of the house, with Runtal hot water radiators on the upper levels, and heated floors on the lower level. Quality propane fire place with authentic stone surround and mantel is a center piece of the great room. White washed oak hardwood floors, extensive tile finishes, one piece toilets, built-in closet organizers, over-sized garage, office, lower level family room, and fenced yard are just some of the additional features of this home.
