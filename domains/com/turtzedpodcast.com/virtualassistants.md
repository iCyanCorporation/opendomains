[Podcast Guest Suggestion](/podcastguestideas)

Join Charlie on TURTZED each week, where authenticity and vulnerability take center stage. In each episode, Charlie strips away the layers of pretense, sharing his personal journey of self-discovery and is joined by guests who share their stories of walking similar paths. This podcast isn’t just a space for listening—it’s a community where everyone is encouraged to show up exactly as they are, no matter where they are in the world.

### Sweet, thoughtful, and deeply introspective. The mission here has so much heart, excited for what’s to come!

-RMBJR (Apple Podcast Review)

### Love this podcast

**Such an authentic, raw and positive podcast… each episode digs deep into everyday people’s challenges & traumas (we all have them!), and how we each confront & hopefully heal and creative a positive from them… so helpful as i continue to face mine, even those that date over a decade ago… love this podcast ❤️🙌❤️🙌**

-JH CHS ❤️ (Apple Podcast Review)

### Deeply personal and honest

**This is the first time I’ve listened to the very first episode of a podcast series and I was very moved. For me, personal and authentic storytelling and discussions are the most valuable way to share and grow.  With warmth, kindness, directness, humor, and a few well placed WTFs, Charlie has established a place of both challenge and safety. I look forward to seeing where he guides us.**

-Megless7 (Apple Podcast Review)

### Incredibly brave to put this out there, respect. And thanks, as a father to young children there are some critical lessons to learn from in this episode. Good work.

-BlueManLIS (Spotify Podcast Review)

### This is Excellent. Well articulated, passionate, and vulnerable.

-witchzilla (Spotify Podcast Review)

### Sharing the journey!

**With every episode I can feel your life’s journey! Moving through your childhood into manhood and now into yourself. Your ability to tell your stories so candidly, and honestly brings me to understand, and feel every step you took towards saving yourself. Thank you so much! I look very forward to more!**
