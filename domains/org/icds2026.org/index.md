Welcome to the 21st International Celiac Disease Symposium 2026
===============================================================

Dear Colleagues,

On behalf of the International Society for the Study of Celiac Disease (ISSCD) and the local organising committee, I am delighted to welcome you to ICDS 2026, to be held at the Melbourne Exhibition and Convention Centre. This symposium marks a significant milestone as the first ICDS hosted in the Southern Hemisphere, and we are thrilled to bring this pre-eminent meeting to the vibrant city of Melbourne, Australia.

ICDS 2026 promises to be an unparalleled gathering for those passionate about improving the lives of people with celiac disease. The ISSCD Board with the ICDS Planning Committee are working to prepare a stimulating and thought-provoking program. Melbourne ICDS 2026 will have a strong focus on inclusivity and innovation and be designed to cater to the diverse needs of our global community. Our goal is to bring together scientists, healthcare professionals, patient associations, industry and patients themselves to work collaboratively towards meaningful solutions for people affected by celiac disease worldwide. Attendees can look forward to a dynamic program packed with the latest science, support for junior researchers and ample opportunities for networking, all complemented by an engaging social program that will allow participants to relax and connect.

Melbourne, known for its cultural diversity, culinary excellence, and world-class amenities, provides an ideal backdrop for our symposium. Whether you are exploring the city's renowned laneways, enjoying its vibrant arts scene, or indulging in its diverse culinary offerings, Melbourne offers something for everyone. We encourage you to take advantage of your time here to experience all that this remarkable city â€“ and Australia - has to offer.

We look forward to welcoming you to Melbourne for an inspiring and productive ICDS 2026. Together, let's advance the field of celiac disease!

Warm regards,

**Jason Tye-Din**
