FAQ
---

### What’s a responsive website theme?

The term ‘responsive’ describes a website’s ability to adjust its display depending how large the user’s screen is. The top menu bar which extends across many webpages on desktop devices is condensed on mobile screens into what’s called a hamburger menu – three horizontal lines at the top‐right corner. Every design theme offered via the UK2 website builder tool is fully responsive, looking equally stylish (and working equally well) on phones and PCs, tablets and televisions.

### Do you support WordPress hosting?

Although we’re understandably proud of our UK2 website builder tool, some of our customers are big fans of WordPress. This content management platform underpins a quarter of the world’s live websites, and we offer optimised WordPress site hosting. We provide rapid loading times courtesy of SSD disk storage. You’ll also receive integrated security, site backups and automatic non‐core software updates as standard.

### Do you offer hosting?

We offer three different hosting packages – Essential, Business and Unlimited Business, the latter including integrated eCommerce features and the ability to accept credit and debit card payments. Regardless of which website hosting package you choose, you’ll receive a free domain name and hosting, generous storage for media files and product inventories, and access to our responsive editing tool. However, you can also import an existing domain name and build your site there.

### Can I boost my site with social media accounts?

You can integrate the main social platforms into a UK2 website, from Facebook and Twitter to LinkedIn and YouTube. You can even add Yelp reviews if your brand is already receiving positive feedback from existing customers.

### Can I integrate third‐party applications?

We support a range of widgets, from Google Maps and email forms to SoundCloud clips and PDF uploads. You can install image galleries and slideshows, or allow people to supply their own data from external platforms like Dropbox. And for eCommerce websites, we offer a secure PayPal Pay Now button.

### What can I do to improve my site’s SEO performance?

Search engines favor sites with SSL certificates, which turn a standard http website into a secure https one. Our Business and Business Unlimited packages include a free SSL certificate. They also prioritise sites with ongoing revisions, like a blog or news page, with keywords used in body text as well as image captions, subheadings and meta descriptions. It’s great to include internal links between webpages on your site, as inbound links to your site from external websites suggest your content is worth viewing.

### Will my site display and work on any device?

The simple answer is yes, though if you start modifying HTML or CSS, there could potentially be display issues on certain devices. Before publishing your site, ask friends and relatives to check that every page displays and functions correctly on as many web‐enabled devices as possible. It’s better for them to identify flaws or inconsistencies than your customers, giving you time to resolve any issues before they’re seen by the general public.

### Can I upgrade my hosting package if my circumstances evolve?

You can upgrade at any time. This may be useful for growing firms who start out on our affordable Business package, but ultimately want to capitalize on the unlimited webpages and integrated eCommerce features offered as part of our Unlimited Business solution.

### Can I transfer web hosting from another provider?

Yes, you can. Our customer support team can assist with domain transfers, site migration and other technical processes. Get in touch to discuss your requirements.

### What if I get stuck?

Although our site-building platform makes it easy to create a website, we realise you may run into obstacles, especially if you’re exploring more advanced features. Our expert support team is ready to assist at any time of the day or night, while our [knowledgebase](/knowledgebase/) is a treasure trove of technical information and how‐to guides.
