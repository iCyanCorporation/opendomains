At Steel Roots Inc., we believe that the environment's health starts with everyone doing their part, this is why we are moving towards more eco-friendly, sustainable products, this starts with energy-efficient welding machines to eco-friendly welding chemicals. 

 Modern welding machines come with energy-efficient features like inverter technology, which allows for a more efficient transfer of electricity. Not only do these machines offer better performance, but they also consume less energy compared to traditional transformer-based machines.

#### Meet the Owner - "Rust Runs in Our Blood."

I am Simone Embrey-Czarnik, I am a 5th-generation Union Journeyman Ironworker and welder. The name "Steel Roots" pays homage to my family. My great-grandfather helped design the flux for welding rods, so the joke in our family is that "Rust runs in our blood", and "Our skill is deeply rooted". 

I wanted to further my education, so I went back to college for my civil engineering, business, and construction management degrees. I have worked on many historical projects in my career, such as the Artemis/ Orion rocket program for NASA and the Vulcan rocket program for ULA. I have worked in aerospace, government bases, theme parks, transportation, mines and much more. I worked for one of the oldest general contractors in the United States, I became tired of corporate America and wanted to start my own local business. I am a woman-owned, LGBTQ business and am currently registering the company under NGLCC, The Pride Chamber of Greater Orlando, and WBENC. Once certificates are established for Steel Roots Inc., they will be posted for review on our website. Diversity is not just our belief but our practice as well.
