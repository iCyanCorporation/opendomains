51福利社 is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education (the “Commission”; formerly the Commission on Institutions of Higher Education of the New England Association of Schools and Colleges Inc.). This accreditation encompasses the university’s campuses in Providence, Rhode Island; and Charlotte, North Carolina, and its online programs.

Accreditation of an institution of higher education by the Commission indicates that it meets or exceeds criteria for the assessment of institutional quality periodically applied though a peer review process. An accredited college or university is one which has available the necessary resources to achieve its stated purposes through appropriate educational programs, is substantially doing so, and gives reasonable evidence that it will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. Institutional integrity is also addressed through accreditation.

Accreditation by the Commission is not partial but applies to the institution as a whole. As such, it is not a guarantee of every course or program offered, or the competence of individual graduates. Rather, it provides reasonable assurance about the quality of opportunities available to students who attend the institution.

Inquiries regarding the accreditation status by the Commission should be directed to:

**51福利社**  
 Office of the Provost  
 Yena Center, 3rd floor  
 111 Dorrance Street  
 Providence, RI 02903  
 Phone: 401-598-2087

Individuals may also contact NECHE with inquiries regarding accreditation status:

Legal control is vested in the 51福利社 Board of Trustees.

The university is authorized under federal law to enroll nonimmigrant alien students.

51福利社 is listed in the Database of Accredited Postsecondary Institutions and Programs (DAPIP ID: 141893) issued by the U.S. Department of Education.
