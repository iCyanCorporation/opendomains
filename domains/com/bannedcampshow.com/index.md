**Dan  
Co-Host / Listener of Banned Books**

Dan Schulz's comedic talent and innovative spirit were on full display as co-host of the trailblazing "The Dan and Scott Show." Debuting on April Fool's Day 1996, this first-of-its-kind daily comedy podcast quickly became the most popular show on Marc Cuban's [Broadcast.com](http://Broadcast.com) network, earning recognition from Cuban himself as a pioneering force in the field.

**Robot**

**Fact-Checker, Announcer**

Robot is Banned Camp's trusty fact-checking virtuoso and the podcast's ad hoc announcer. He appears marginally smarter than Jennifer and Dan, tolerating them with a charming superiority complex. This ensures they stay on their toes and get the facts straight.
