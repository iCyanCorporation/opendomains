**[*On ashes*](Project-1)**   
Special edition A short essay on my mother’s ashes, alongside thoughts on travel, loss and flowers.   
  
The special edition set includes two B5 prints: “From A Temple Garden (花)” printed in fluorescent red and “Where Zushi and Hayama Meet (玻)”, an image of beach glass, plastics and shells gathered from a beach near where my mother grew up. The 花 print is from a photograph taken at a women’s Buddhist temple off a small road in Kamakura, Japan. As I walked by the gate, a hand-painted sign there struck me as a particularly expressive notion of flower. It told of how and when the garden at this temple is cared for.  
  
The essay is printed in green ink on four different subtle paper colors to pick from (tan, green, pink and gray).
