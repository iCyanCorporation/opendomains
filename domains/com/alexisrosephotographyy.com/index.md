Meet Me
=======

Hi! Im Alexis, for those of you who dont know me. I picked up a camera at a very young age for fun and 5 years ago I fell in love. Through out the years Ive developed my own style and stay true to it.

Starting photography has been something I will forever be thankful for. Both building relationships with new people and being able to do something I love at the same time makes it even more special. Being a photographer that shoots in outdoor settings more often than not, gives more of a natural theme to my photos- capturing all the moments that matter most to us. That being said, I do love a good at home simple backdrop session! ​

Photos aren't just something to frame on the wall, they're memories that will last forever. Capturing photos with me is much more than that. The laughs and moments not paying attention to the camera are the ones we love the most.
