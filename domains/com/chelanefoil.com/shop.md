eFoil Lake Chelan
=================

All About eFoils
================

An eFoil is a surfboard with an electric propeller behind the wing of the hydrofoil, which powers the board to move through any water conditions. The eFoil is powered by a nearly silent electric motor and rechargeable battery. It’s controlled by a handheld wireless remote that syncs to the eFoil via Bluetooth.

​

The eFoil rider does not need to paddle for waves or pump with their legs to keep the board in motion. An eFoil is basically the world’s smallest (and most fun) personal, motorized watercraft.

​

We own and have instructed on the two leading foils currently on the market, Flite and Lift eFoils. We have made the full switch to Flite eFoils as we have found the safety, performance, and innovation have surpassed the competition within the last few years. The motors are quiet, emission-free, and can reach speeds of up to 25 miles per hour. They can run for over 90 minutes on a single charge! We are an Authorized FliteSchool, Reseller and Service Provider. Flite currently produces four different size boards for all experience levels as well as customizable foils. At eFoil Chelan we like to set you up on a board that is suitable for your experience level and challenge you to smaller setups as you progress.
