### Unispace has won two Health and Safety awards from the prestigious [Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents](https://www.rospa.com/) and the [British Safety Council](https://www.britsafe.org/awards-and-events/awards/international-safety-awards) for our continued outstanding health and safety practices!

At Unispace we are committed to ensuring safe and healthy spaces wherever we have a presence. Therefore, we are extremely proud to announce that we have been recognised with a Merit in the International Safety Awards at the British Safety Council and Commended by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) in the ‘Construction Commercial Sector’ category, building on the Gold Award we received [last year](/news/emea-rospa-award).   
  
The Unispace ISO certified Integrated Management Systems (IMS) enshrines our commitment to health and safety through design, construction and occupation of the spaces we create as well as the offices and studios we occupy. We are committed to compliance across all the territories where we operate, continual improvement of the IMS and ensuring that employees, contractors, clients and visitors all go home from work in the same condition as they arrived.   
  
Our [Safer Together](/news/think-safe-putting-our-words-into-actions) programme encompasses training, awareness, sharing lessons and initiatives on health and safety at all levels of the business and our supply chain encouraging a culture of health and safety ownership which we are immensely proud of.

> "At Unispace, we have worked hard to embed systems and processes to drive our health and safety culture. Receiving a Commended Award in the ‘Construction Commercial Sector’ is huge endorsement of everything we have worked hard to achieve. I would like to extend my gratitude and appreciation to all our teams and leadership across Unispace EMEA who have contributed to this huge achievement and bringing our Safer Together programme to life!"
>
> - Paul Stoelker, Principal, Health & Safety EMEA

### 

### The RoSPA Awards

The [RoSPA Awards](https://www.rospa.com/awards) is one of the most prestigious and recognised health and safety schemes in the world with almost 2,000 entries every year from more than 50 countries, with a total reach of over seven million employees. Running for nearly 70 years, it recognises and rewards organisations, individuals and teams that go above and beyond to achieve health and safety excellence.

> Workplace accidents don't just pose financial risks and operational disruptions; they significantly impact the quality of life for individuals. This is why acknowledging and rewarding excellent safety performance is vital.
>
> We congratulate Unispace for winning a prestigious RoSPA Award and showing an unwavering commitment to keeping employees, clients and customers safe from accidental harm and injury.
>
> - Julia Small, RoSPA’s Achievements Director

### **The International Safety Awards**

Now in their 65th year, the [International Safety Awards](https://www.britsafe.org/awards/international-safety-awards) recognise and celebrate organisations from around the world which have demonstrated to the satisfaction of the scheme’s independent judges their commitment to preventing workplace injuries and work-related ill health during the previous calendar year. The awards also acknowledge organisations that have shown commitment to wellbeing and mental health at work.

> “The vision of British Safety Council is that no-one should be injured or made ill through their work – anywhere in the world. Achieving this requires more than complying with legislation; it means people committed not only to health and safety but also more and more to workplace wellbeing and impelling others to follow suit.”
>
> - Mike Robinson, Chief Executive of British Safety Council
