Internal Family Systems:
========================

### A Path to Reclaiming Your Higher, Most Radiant Self

We were all born whole and radiant
----------------------------------

Yet, as we navigate life, we collect stories and beliefs, and we notice parts of ourselves that we don’t love or accept.

Instinctively, we want to fix them, but this drive to heal and make things 'right' often leads us to feel even more constrained.

About me
--------

With over 20 years guided by high achievement, including educational credentials from Cornell and MIT and a resume I once took great pride in, my journey took a profound shift as I began to unravel what felt 'off' about my life and sought deeper meaning.

This search for alignment and purpose led me to the teachings of Martha Beck, where I discovered Internal Family Systems (IFS). Through IFS, I gained more than just a framework; it enabled me to understand, appreciate, and accept all parts of myself.

As I continue my work and move towards greater harmony within my internal system, I have begun to experience a profound connection with the universe’s energies, feeling increasingly in sync with the cosmic flow.
