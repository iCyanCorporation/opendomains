“In my opinion, AFSI Grads’ CLINIC is absolutely a paramount key to developing your classical Feng Shui skills. As a long-time AFSI student, I’ve benefited from participating in the clinic sessions, and I know that newer students will gather even more support from attending. AFSI’s Executive Director, PK Odle, brings her vibrant enthusiasm, deep knowledge, and decades of experience to each member during clinic sessions. Her guidance method goes step-by-step and includes the why behind key aspects that permit AFSI students to use the techniques we’ve studied either in-person or online. I highly recommend joining me in this amazing opportunity to be mentored by PK to develop your Feng Shui competency further.”

Meet PK Odle
============

Master Feng Shui Consultant &  
Executive Director of The American Feng Shui Institute®.

PK’s mission for the AFSI Grads’ CLINIC is to empower graduates to master the practice of classical Yi Jing Feng Shui as the ancient sister science to Acupuncture that it is. Since meeting Master Sang in 1996, she has devoted her life to the study and practice of classical Yi Jing Feng Shui. In addition, PK remains committed to deepening her knowledge of Feng Shui by attending every AFSI class. She began teaching in-person and online for AFSI in May of 1998, and in January of 2014, she accepted the role of AFSI’s Executive Director.

As an internationally respected AFSI instructor, PK has assisted Master Sang on all 4 AFSI China trips. During AFSI’s last trip, she joined a handful of AFSI graduates attending an exclusive class arranged by Master Sang with the International Association of Yi Jing Studies in Beijing. In 1999, PK became Master Sang’s assistant in the Institute’s office in Monterey Park, CA, and on occasion, she acted as his assistant on Feng Shui readings. In addition, as a member of the Institute’s American Society of Feng Shui and American Yi Jing Study Center, PK also assisted with the coordination and facilitation of many Society events.

As a reminder, AFSI’s founder Master Larry Sang is an internationally recognized authority on Feng Shui, the Yi Jing (I Ching), and all forms of Chinese Astrology. He’s respected for his thorough academic knowledge of those subjects. In 2005, Master Sang was appointed to an advisory position on China’s Architectural Culture Center board to work on the 2008 Beijing Olympic village.

Since 1997, PK Odle’s private consulting company, The Feng Shui Advantage®, has worked with business owners internationally who want to be more productive and profitable while enjoying better health and relationships.

“Thank you so much! This clinic is the opportunity I’ve been seeking to receive clear answers to my questions without leaving my country or my house! PK shares a variety of practical examples and advises us on dealing with clients. Thus, we can get a glimpse of having a professional Feng Shui practice.”
