**SECTION 4 – DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER**

PLEASE READ THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND YOUR RIGHTS. EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM THAT YOU MAY HAVE IN THE FUTURE MUST BE RESOLVED THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. THE RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO THE COURTS, SUCH AS DISCOVERY OR THE RIGHT TO APPEAL, MAY BE MORE LIMITED OR MAY NOT EXIST. YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY ONLY BRING A CLAIM IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF (LEAD OR OTHERWISE) OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OR CLAIMS OR OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.

Except as provided below and to enforce an arbitrator’s decision hereunder, all disputes, controversies, or claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement or a breach thereof, our relationship, or your use or attempted use of the Website or any product or service offered by the Company, shall be submitted to and finally resolved by individual, confidential arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. The following terms shall apply. You, the Company, or any involved third party may pursue a claim. The Company agrees to final and binding confidential arbitration should it have any claims against you. Likewise, you agree to final and binding confidential arbitration should you have any claims against the Company. By agreeing to arbitrate, you waive the right to go to court and agree instead to submit any claims to final and binding confidential arbitration. This arbitration provision sets forth the terms and conditions of our agreement to final and binding confidential arbitration and is governed by and enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, as amended.

**Commencing Arbitration:** You and the Company agree to commence any arbitration proceeding within 1 year after the claim arises and that any arbitration proceeding commenced after 1 year shall be forever barred.

**Arbitration Location:** If the amount in controversy is $500 or less, then the arbitration may be conducted by telephone or by written submissions. Otherwise, the arbitration shall be conducted in Utah unless the Company otherwise agrees to arbitrate in another forum requested by you.

**Organization, Rules, and the Arbitrator:** We each agree that any and all claims other than those exempted below shall be submitted to final and binding confidential arbitration before a single arbitrator of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). The arbitrator shall be selected by agreement of the parties or if the parties cannot agree, chosen in accordance with the Rules of the AAA. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the AAA’s Commercial Dispute Resolutions Procedures, and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, in effect at the time of submission of the demand for arbitration. The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, construction, validity, applicability, or enforceability of these Terms and this arbitration provision. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether any dispute is arbitrable. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether this arbitration agreement can be enforced against a non-signatory to this agreement and whether a non-signatory to this agreement can enforce this provision against you or the Company.

**Fees:** Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s Rules. In our sole discretion, we may reimburse the fees charged by the arbitrator for claims totaling less than $500.00 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, we will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. In all other respects, the parties shall each pay their own additional fees, costs, and expenses, including, but not limited to, those for any attorneys, experts, documents, and witnesses.

**Governing Law and Award:** The arbitrator shall follow the substantive law of the State of Utah without regard to its conflicts of laws principles. Any award rendered shall include a confidential written opinion and shall be final, subject to appeal under the FAA. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

**Enforceability:** This provision survives the termination of your account or relationship with the Company, bankruptcy, assignment, or transfer. If the class action waiver is deemed unenforceable (i.e., unenforceability would allow arbitration to proceed as a class or representative action), then this entire arbitration provision shall be rendered null and void and shall not apply. If a portion of this arbitration provision (other than the class action waiver) is deemed unenforceable, the remaining portions of this arbitration provision shall remain in full force and effect.

**Miscellaneous:** Failure or any delay in enforcing this arbitration provision in connection with any particular claim will not constitute a waiver of any rights to require arbitration at a later time or in connection with any other Claims except all claims must be brought within the 1-year limitation period set forth above. This Section 4 is the entire arbitration agreement between you and the Company and shall not be modified except in writing by the Company.

**Exceptions:** Notwithstanding the foregoing, and as an exception to final and binding confidential arbitration, you and the Company both retain the right to pursue, in small claims court, any claim that is within that court’s jurisdiction and proceeds on an individual (non-class) basis, including overdue account matters within the small claims court’s jurisdiction. The Company will not demand arbitration in connection with any individual claim that you properly file and pursue in a small claims court, so long as the claim is and remains pending in that court. The following claims shall not be subject to final and binding arbitration and must be adjudicated only in the state or federal courts located, Utah, with the parties forever waiving any challenge to said court’s jurisdiction and venue: (i) any dispute, controversy, or claim, including a claim for injunctive relief and damages, relating to the infringement or validity of our proprietary rights, including without limitation, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, copyrights, trade secrets, or patents, or the intellectual property rights of a third party; or (ii) action by the Company for temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief, whether prohibitive or mandatory or other provisional relief, against you for breach or threatened breach of this Agreement. You expressly agree to refrain from bringing or joining any claims that are excluded from final and binding arbitration pursuant to this subsection “h” in any representative or class-wide capacity, including but not limited to bringing or joining any claims in any class action or any class-wide arbitration.

**Amendments:** The company reserves the right to amend this arbitration provision at any time. Your continued use of the Website or use or attempted use of any of the Company’s products or services is the affirmation of your consent to such changes. Should the changes to this arbitration provision be material, the Company will provide you notice and an opportunity to opt-out. Your failure to opt out of material changes to this arbitration provision is the affirmation of your consent to such material changes.

**SECTION 5 – INDEMNIFICATION**

To the fullest extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Company, its directors, officers, employees, shareholders, licensors, independent contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, affiliates, parent companies, subsidiaries, and agents from and against any and all claims, actions, loss, liabilities, damages, expenses, demands, and costs of any kind, including, but not limited to attorneys’ fees and costs of any litigation or other dispute resolution, arising out of, resulting from, or in any way connected with or related to (1) your use, misuse, or attempt to use the Website, software, products, or services, (2) information you submit or transmit through the Website, (3) your breach of these Terms, the documents they incorporate by reference, the Agreement, or the representations and warranties provided by you in this Agreement, or (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third-party.

**SECTION 6 – NOTICE AND TAKEDOWN PROCEDURES; COPYRIGHT ACT**

If You believe that materials or content available on any Company website infringes any copyright You own, You or Your agent may send the Company a notice requesting that the Company remove the materials or content from the Company website. If You believe that someone has wrongly filed a notice of copyright infringement against You, You may send Company a counter-notice.

**SECTION 7 – GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE**

This Agreement and any issue or dispute arising out of or otherwise related to this Agreement or any matter concerning the Company shall be governed exclusively by the laws of the State of Utah without regard to its conflicts of laws principles. To the extent that any claim or dispute is found by the arbitrator or (if proper) a court of competent jurisdiction to be excluded from the arbitration agreement in Section 4 above, the parties agree any such claim or dispute shall be exclusively brought in and decided by the state or federal courts located, Utah and you hereby irrevocably consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of, and exclusive venue in, such courts, and forever waive any challenge to said courts’ exclusive jurisdiction or venue. All such claims must be brought on an individual and non-class, non-representative basis, and you forever waive any right to bring such claims on a class-wide or representative basis.

**SECTION 8 – SEVERABILITY**

If any provision of this Agreement is found by the arbitrator or (if proper) a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall not be affected thereby and shall continue in full force and effect and such provision may be modified or severed from this Agreement to the extent necessary to make such provision enforceable and consistent with the remainder of the Agreement.
