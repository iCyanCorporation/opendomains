About the IILN
--------------

The IILN was established by law firm Mishcon de Reya in 2024 and is an international network of lawyers, specialising in immigration.

### What we do

The IILN is a network of immigration professionals. The network is without exclusivity and allows advisors to maintain their independence, whilst having access to a pool of trusted immigration professionals around the globe.

Our purpose is to create long lasting relationships with our members, to share immigration law knowledge, and to provide our clients with best in class advice in the jurisdictions they may seek to relocate to. In an increasingly mobile world, advisors may be called upon to compare and contrast the advantages of a number of immigration options for their clients, whether they are employment, family, investment, business-establishment based or other.

By bringing together a network of high-calibre immigration advisers on a global scale, members can benefit from new connections to enhance their knowledge and provide integrated solutions for their clients.

##### [International Immigration Lawyers Network Quarterly Newsletter](https://immigrationlawyersnetwork.com/international-immigration-lawyers-network-quarterly-newsletter/)

[A very warm welcome to the network and I am delighted to share our first newsletter with you. Thank you to all those who have contributed. We established the IILN in August 2024 with the intention of creating a best-in-class network of international immigration advisers. In an increasingly global world, clients require holistic immigration advice which enables them to compare and contrast the advantages of various immigration systems around the world. The rationale for creating a network of immigration advisers is therefore, at its heart, to better serve our clients and ensure they receive quality of advice in the jurisdictions they may seek to relocate to. In addition to this, knowledge sharing and creating long-lasting relationships between members are also key cornerstones of the network.](https://immigrationlawyersnetwork.com/international-immigration-lawyers-network-quarterly-newsletter/)

##### [Cayman Islands: Recent Trends In Residency By Investment](https://immigrationlawyersnetwork.com/cayman-islands-recent-trends-in-residency-by-investment/)

[As we have all seen in recent years, obtaining an alternative right of residence (in some cases citizenship), and an ability to leave one country and settle in another, is becoming increasingly important for our clients. Allied to this, as the world becomes ever more interconnected, so does the attractiveness and viability of making lifestyle choices about where to reside and conduct business.](https://immigrationlawyersnetwork.com/cayman-islands-recent-trends-in-residency-by-investment/)
