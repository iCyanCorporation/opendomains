The Old Threshers Foundation supports a growing, thriving Midwest Old Settlers and Threshers Association. The experiences people share at the Old Threshers Reunion and in touring the Heritage Museums are priceless. Families come from miles around to join in a walk through the past. Please help us preserve, nurture and protect our historical agricultural treasures for future generations to enjoy.
