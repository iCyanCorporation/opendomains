The Outsiders Studio
====================

We are a creative culinary studio based in the woods in Sussex, UK. We produce multisensory experiences through the medium of food that allow for deep engagement in nature.​

We collaborate with ethnobotanists, artists, scientists, growers and other local food activists to explore ancient and contemporary flavour perceptions  in an attempt to form more autonomous, hybridized food practices in our current climate of urgency. ​As part of Our Forest Flavours, The Sensory Table  as well as our hands-on School of Taste programme, our mission is to educate people on the cultural and social significance of taste.   

We are not here to only feed and delight but to inspire and offer a slice of tangible, untethered magic with visions of a kinder, sustainable future to maintain and grow our biodiversity of taste.​​​
