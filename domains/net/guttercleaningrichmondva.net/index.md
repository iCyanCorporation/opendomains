Clean Pro is great! Ray, who typically services my house, is very thorough and takes his time to make sure all the debris is removed from my gutters and downspouts. He treats my house as though it were his own--that's how good he is. I'm very pleased with Clean Pro Gutter Cleaning.

We contacted Clean Pro Gutter Cleaning because we had one of our downspouts clogged and were expecting heavy rains within a day or two. The Clean Pro representative was very helpful and their team were able to schedule us for a service call within the time frame we needed. There technician called and confirmed the service appointment and even though we were having heavy rain when he arrived he was able to not only clear the blockage but completed initial cleaning on most of the other gutters. He returned the following day and finished cleaning all remaining gutters and cleaned up the debris even though we were still having intermittent heavy showers. We have a two story home with gutters on both levels and all were cleaned. Overall we are very happy with all staff and the technician we dealt with and recommend this company without reservation.

Our Superior 6-Step Gutter Cleaning Process
-------------------------------------------

1. **Clearing Gutters of Debris:** We begin by removing the leaves, twigs, pine needles, seed pods and other debris from your property’s guttering using special hand tools, ensuring obstructions are removed from the gutter channels.
2. **Unclog Downspouts:** Downspouts are checked for blockages and clogging and cleared where necessary.
3. **Flushing of Gutters and Downspouts:** The entire system of gutters and downspouts is flushed using high-pressure equipment. This clears any dirt and grime to ensure efficient water flow.
4. **Rainwater Flow Test and Inspection:** The roof drainage system is inspected for drainage, leaks, damage, and wear. Any minor problems will be recognized and can be repaired if required.
5. **Exterior Clean (Optional):** The system’s exterior is cleaned, leaving your gutters and downspouts gleaming, restoring the curb appeal of your home.
6. **Disposal of Debris:** Debris is gathered, bagged up, gotten rid of from your yard, and disposed of in accordance with City of Richmond council guidelines
