###### ABOUT KRISTENSEN LAW

###### ABOUT KRISTENSEN LAW GROUP

Trusted & Experienced Trial Lawyers
-----------------------------------

Kristensen Law Group only accepts select cases. The primary factors in our selection process is if the client is willing to fight and work with us, and also is the defendant a bully. We despise bullies. It’s also unfair to our other clients, if one does not want to do the work on their case.

Unlike most firms that only are comfortable handling one or two types of cases, we use our legal abilities to litigate any cases in State or Federal Court. In the past few years, we have litigated cases in California, Oregon, Alabama, Florida, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New York, Rhode Island, Virginia, Texas, Georgia, North Carolina, Kentucky, Indiana, and Arizona.

### FORMER CLIENT

> September of 2007 we lost our son in a car accident. January 2008 we received a recall on the vehicle he was driving. We took it upon our selves to have the accident reconstructed and found that in fact it very well could have been a faulty part. We search and searched for a wrongful death lawyer which brought us to Stewart Carty GOD REST IS SOLE. Stewart was a little fish in a big sea going against a giant ( Toyota Motor Company). However Stewart was able to bring in some reinforcement John Kristensen. John was always available to answer our questions and very compassionate. A man of his word. Unfortunately Stewart passed before our case was settled but John took the bull by the horns and fought us thru to the very end. If your looking for 5 stars John is your guy in our opinion. Mike and Shawna Stewart

###### FAQS

###### FAQS

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

We created this FAQ section to provide you with answers to more general personal injury law questions in California. However, at Kristensen Law, our experienced personal injury lawyers can answer questions related to your case. Please call us at 805-837-2000 or contact us via email for more specific answers to your important questions.

#### [What is a personal injury lawsuit?](#collapse-1301)

A personal injury lawsuit can be filed when you've been hurt by a person or entity (a business, organization, or government agency) because of a negligent or intentionally wrongful act. A personal injury can be anything from physical harm suffered in a car accident to emotional distress that's the result of someone committing libel or slander against you.

#### [What can I recover in a California personal injury case?](#collapse-1302)

In a personal injury case, the only remedy is money. If you file a personal injury lawsuit, part of the claim will be a request for a certain amount of “damages,” which is the money that the defendant is obligated to pay you if you win. Your lawyer can help determine what your demand should be based on how much you've lost.

The basis for personal injury law is to make the plaintiff “whole”. In other words, it's intended to restore you to the position you would be in if the accident hadn't happened. The way the court does this is by awarding money that will cover any expenses associated with the injury.

#### [Are there damage caps in California personal injury lawsuits?](#collapse-1303)

Some states have damage caps, which means there's a maximum amount a plaintiff can recover for a personal injury.

In California, you can always recover your economic damages to the fullest extent. The only damage cap in state statute is on non-economic damages (for instance, pain and suffering) specifically for medical malpractice cases. If you're a plaintiff in a medical malpractice case in California, you can recover up to $250,000 in non-economic damages.

#### [How do I prove fault in a California personal injury lawsuit?](#collapse-1304)

In every personal injury lawsuit, the plaintiff faces the burden of proof to demonstrate that these elements exist:

* Duty
* Breach
* Causation
* Foreseeability
* Damages

Everyone owes a duty of care to the people around them, whether they're fellow drivers, bicyclists, pedestrians, retail store patrons, a doctor/patient relationship, or any other situation that relates one person to another. That means you have a duty to act or *not* act in a certain way in order to avoid causing harm to other people.

#### [What Are The Statute Of Limitations In California?](#collapse-1305)

You must initiate a personal injury claim before the statute of limitations expires. In Texas, most personal injury cases are subject to a two-year statute of limitations. Any personal injury lawsuit must be filed within two years of the date of the accident. Though, there are some limited exceptions to our state’s general statute of limitations. You may have more or less time to file in certain circumstances. A California personal injury lawyer can answer questions about the statute of limitations.

#### [What Should I Do to Protect My Rights After an Accident?](#collapse-1306)

Following a serious accident, it is crucial that you take the proper steps to protect your health, safety, well-being, and legal rights. To start, injured victims should seek immediate attention from a qualified doctor. Not only is seeing a doctor important for your health, you must see a doctor to be eligible to bring a personal injury claim. Beyond seeing a doctor, it is important to proactively document your accident. The sooner you consult with an experienced personal injury lawyer, the better position you will be in to bring a legal claim.

#### [How Much Is My Personal Injury Claim Worth?](#collapse-1307)

With a small exception for punitive damages, California allows injured victims to seek compensatory damages. In other words, the value of your personal injury claim will be worth the actual extent of your economic and non-economic damages. To get a better idea of what your injury claim could be worth, contact Kristensen Law now.
