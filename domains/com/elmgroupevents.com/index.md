My career as a senior leader in a multi-billion retailer has honed my collaborative prowess, while a strategic academic foundation adds a unique edge to our planning. This translates over to partnering with vendors at a level most never operate at.

#### Why I DJ?

#### I Love Making People Dance

#### Why I DJ?

DJing is my therapy. It's my reset button, a chance to recalibrate amidst the frenzy. Whether it's an intimate house gathering, a high-energy club night or the elegance of a wedding, I find all my sanctuary. The thrill of curating beats that synchronize with smiles is my ultimate reward. I'm  privileged to craft evenings of such joy.
