Frequently answered questions
-----------------------------

Explore a wide range of burning questions

How is this different than an agency/contractor/other
subscription service?

I offer competitive pricing tailored for today's economy. Your
website will not only be WCAG-compliant but also has seamless
online booking. With a focus on accessibility and
user-friendliness, your data's security and privacy are my top
priorities. Seamlessly integrating with CRM and chatbots, I
ensure your online presence is always up-to-date and supported,
guaranteeing a smooth experience



Can I cancel my service subscription?

You are in control of your subscription - cancel anytime with
ease. Simply visit your account settings, locate 'Manage
Subscription,' & choose cancel.



Is there anything you can't handle?

Of course, everything comes with a catch. I don't offer brand
logo design, social media management, advanced SEO,
illustration, 3D design, ads retarging, PPC, web app or mobile
app development.



How can I reach customer support?

You can contact me via email, live chatbot in this website, and
phone. Visit 'Contact me' page for more details and to get in
touch.



How soon can I expect to see the design or development
completed?

On average, I aim to deliver within 2 days, but for special
requests, I may need a little extra time to perfect them.



Why wouldn't I just hire big agencies?

Hiring a big agency for your website and booking needs may come
with a high price tag due to their overheads and reputation.
However, I can offer competitive rates without compromising
quality. Additionally, I can provide more personalized attention
and flexibility, while offering better communication channels
and quicker response times.



What tools do you use?

I'm using Figma, Tailwind CSS, Astro for static pages and Dorik
for CMS
