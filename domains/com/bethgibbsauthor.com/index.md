When Reva Quinn’s life in Seattle shattered, she had to call her estranged aunt to take her to a witch commune on the Oregon coast. Reva just wants to recover in her new home and get to know her weird new roommates, but there a demon has other plans for her. She doesn’t want to battle evil certainly doesn’t want to be a witch, not one with incredible unpredictable powers to bring storms. But Reva can’t keep running from her true self. She has to face her past and her unpredictable power to save her new community and ultimately, herself.

Beth

Beth Gibbs is an author who loves bringing the magic of the American West to life in her fiction. She writes about strong women, witches and spirits who face battles while living outside the norms. In all of her work, food plays a big role, due to her own love of culinary creations, and because a character going through rough times still needs to enjoy life. Beth lives in Portland, Oregon with her husband and loves to go on adventures, from local hikes to road trips to walks all over the world. She has a background in fine arts and human resources and comes from a family of storytellers. Her upcoming novel, Pacific North Witch, will be available at [Not A Pipe Publishing](http://www.notapipepublishing.com/) October 15th, 2024.
