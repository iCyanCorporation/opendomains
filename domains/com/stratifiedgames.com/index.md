Welcome to Stratified Games

As a new and independent board games developer, we welcome gamers to connect and get involved.

We love board games that engage the imagination to challenge players with deep logistics, layers and strategy.

Our first game, *Realms of the Ghost Machine*, is currently undergoing trials in the form of a physical prototype board game and a virtual version on Tabletop Simulator. We are actively seeking volunteers to trial our game online. Click the ‘Play’ button below for instructions on how to join our growing community.

About the Game…
---------------

Prototype game trial

### Introduction

The contrap, a magical amulet driven by the ghosts trapped inside, had many owners before falling into the hands of Tyler May. This ghost machine can make the wearer fly, see through walls and do many other amazing things. It’s also a gateway into two ghostly realms where places drift from here to there, and ghosts wait to be discovered: the Ghost Portal, where ghosts roam, and the Brimstone Chasm, a hellish realm of ghosts imprisoned by monsters.

### Objective

Be the first to build your team of ghosts and spies, as you fight to protect the Living Realm. The first player to gain 10 victory points wins the game! Players gain victory points for each ghost and spy token on the main board and for each revealed Ghost card.

**For further information please [download the Rule Book PDF](https://www.stratifiedgames.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Realms-Rule-Book_v7.06.pdf).**

### The Inspiration

*Realms of the Ghost Machine* was inspired by the young adult fantasy *Tyler May Series* of novels by author B J Mears. Ben is also a graphic designer and creative developer, and has been developing the game since early 2023.

In her adventures, Tyler May uses the Contrap – a ghost machine with many abilities – to enter the *ghostly realms*. The game board represents this, rotating to reveal the various realms as play dictates.
