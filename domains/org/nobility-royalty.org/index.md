Note what is says in the first paragraph of the Foreword:**   **The whole field of nobility and royalty is in disarray and confusion. It is rife with falsehoods, misguided experts, phony princes, and counterfeit chivalric orders. Besides the numerous scams and charlatans that exist, there is a widespread misunderstanding of the international and natural laws that govern dynastic rights. This is a field that is truly divided. This sad state of affairs need not continue. If international law is honored, revered and respected, then everything can be set in its proper order. The grand key to this needed unity is the rule of the just, time-honored laws that already exist.**   **The author is Dr. Stephen Baca y Kerr, JD, LLM, MAT, former special counsel to the Imperial and Royal House of Habsburg, Professor and Dean of the Law School at the International College of Interdisciplinary Studies. His book is** ***The Entitlement to Rule: Legal, Non-Territorial Sovereignty in International Law*** **and it is a masterpiece. Note excerpts of what people have said about it:**   **"It is written in a clear and compelling manner. It is hoped that more and more people will become familiar with the laws of justice contained in this book."** (Thubten Samphel, director of the Tibet Policy Institute of the Central Tibetan Administration and author of the book *Falling Through the Roof,* Dharamshala, India)   **"It is magnificently done and of great worth."** (Adalberto J. Urbina Briceno, Sc.D., Professor Head of the Public International Law Chair of the Catholic University Andres Bello- Caracas)   **"It is a goldmine of references and is a valuable account of a [thought provoking] . . . and poorly understood area of law."** (Rev'd Professor Noel Cox, LLM, MA, MTheol, Ph.D., LTh, FRHists, Barrister, Aberystwyth University, New Zealand)   **"Dr. Kerr has put together a book that is a "one of a kind" providing what is needed to perpetuate the rights of deposed sovereignty. For all those interested in the legal future of nobility and royalty, this is a very important, scholarly and insightful book to read."** (LaWanna Blount, Ph.D., F.Coll.T, vice president and professor at the American College of Interdisciplinary Sciences, Como, Mississippi, USA)   **"Dr. Kerr's book . . . is one of those . . . path breaking works that throws new light on a field of study . . . on the complex legal and philosophical sinews that keep alive [deposed] monarchies. . . . This type of writing fills a huge gap within the royal studies field. . . ."** (Dr. Diana Mandache, historian and author, Budapest, Romania)   **"The author obviously has a deep understanding of international law and how it relates to deposed monarchies and exiled governments. The content is well structured and well written. I accept this book as conforming to the highest academic standards expected of a master scholar and practitioner."** (Alexander Arapov, Sc.D., Professor of the Department of Philosophy and Sociology of the All-Russian State Distance-Learning Institute of Finance and Economics, a branch of the Financial University of the Russian Federation)   **"This has been the most interesting and helpful book I have read in the field of nobiliary law as well as international law . . . . It exemplifies the highest level of scholarly content, clarity and depth of inquiry yet presented on this profound and important subject."** (Prof. Dr. Mirjana Radovic-Markovic, Academician, Institute of Economic Sciences and Faculty of Business Economics and Entrepreneurship, Belgrade, Serbia)   **This unique book is being offered for free because of its singular importance to the field of nobility and royalty. Go to the website:** [**www.entitlement-to-rule.info**](http://www.entitlement-to-rule.info/ "http://www.entitlement-to-rule.info")**.**   **The International Commission on Nobility and Royalty** presently consists of over 60 members and contributors and seven board members and officers. This includes some scholars and experts in the field of nobility and royalty and a working association with four royal houses. No one is paid -- everything is done voluntarily. This association is organized to benefit society with what we consider to be of great worth and value. We average about at least 5,000+ hits a day. (See our "[**Public Newsletter**](id63.html "May 2020 Public Newsletter")") Our main goal and purpose is education to dispel the various misunderstandings that exist about Constitutional Monarchy, Royalty, Nobility and Chivalry, and show how it is really a shining gift that benefits those countries that either adopt it or preserve it.   In fact, research has shown that those countries that have constitutional monarchsgenerally have the best economies, wealth, prosperity, freedom and stability on the earth.  (see "[**Ideals**](the_ideals_of_nobility_and_royalty.html "IDEALS")" and "[**Advantages**](criticisms_and_benefits_of_monarchy.html "ADVANTAGES")")   **The Problem and the Purpose**   **The International Commission on Nobility and Royalty** was originally conceived to protect the field of nobility and royalty from modern day pirates who impersonate, and by their fraudulent declarations defame and denigrate those who hold authentic titles and valid claims. Education through articles are the chief means the Commission will use to defend and preserve the field from the menacing forces that are presently besieging it and denigrating its members.   Regrettably, there are literally thousands of people with phony titles of nobility, who claim royal or noble descent. They are masquerading as genuine title holders throughout the earth. Some thirty or more foul organizations are deceifully pumping out hundreds of counterfeit title holders, and at least forty plus self-appointed phony orders of chivalry exist -- giving out imitation knighthoods rather than authentic ones. By the turn of the century, this kind of fraud has more than quadrupled. The problem is, not only are they fake, but title inflation cheapens the greatness of those who are real, and hold authentic titles and genuine honors.   Another way this hurts what is real, is that number of these self-deceived impersonators believe they are suddenly high class and give out bad examples, which makes what is real look bad. That is, instead of being unpretentious and dignified, they are, to some degree, showy, high minded and haughty, which behaviour turns people off; such that, those who deal with them tend to consider all title holders with distain as snobby individuals. The legitimate nobles are not this way, but it is often quite difficult to discern the actual and real from the fakes without specialize knowledge -- hence, the existence and importance of this website.   Others claim illustrious ancestors based on nothing more than family fairy tales or vague legends passed down through the generations, or because of unscrupulous greedy men who sell unproven pedigrees on the internet to the unwary and unguarded.   In general, internet fraud is a frightening and growing problem. The **Internet Crime Complaint Center** reports over $500 million worth dalors worth of fraud in 2010. This huge amount only expresses what has been complained about to the authorities. Much more fraud actual occurred -- probably seven to eight times as much, but was never reported. This kind of crime is rampant and epidemic. It also exists in the field of nobility and royalty.   It is a very sad and undeniable fact that we live in a day of increasing frauds, bogus titles and scoundrels who plunder and take advantage of the innocent and the ignorant. Hence, there really needs to be a practical and effective organization designed to help protect the public and safeguard it from the lies and deceit of the self-proclaimed title consultants, fake knighthoods and unaccredited genealogists.   Another threat to the field is the domestic or nationalistic belief that any title of nobility given by a former sovereign house in current times is for private use only and has no worth or value, because no government will recognize it. However, under international law, deposed royal houses are legally sovereign and therefore can preserve those rights by obedience to the laws that can preserve it intact from generation to generation. (Please see the article [**DEPOSED SOVEREIGNTY AND ROYALTY: how to preserve it and how to lose it**](the_sovereign_rights_of_deposed_kings__monarchs_and_sovereign_princes.html "DEPOSED SOVEREIGNTY AND ROYALTY: How to "))   The International Commission has been organized as a private, non-public organization. It was with the idea in mind of protecting the public like a professional association or licensing board would. It has not been set up to expose false nobility or make believe titles, but to educate people so they can recognize counterfeiters as some create impressive websites, and mislead very skillfully.   Another equally important priority is to promote the ideals of nobility, royalty and monarchy in modern times, including its illustrious past, its future and its potential to benefit all mankind. (see "[**Ideals**](the_ideals_of_nobility_and_royalty.html "IDEALS")" and "[**Monarchy and Nobility: Divine Rights & Responsibilities**](id54.html "MONARCHY AND NOBILITY: DIVINE RIGHTS  RE")") This basic priority.   We have the ambition of making it eminently obvious to all people that constitutional monarchy is a choice that has brought prosperity and stability to most of the richest and most democratic nations on earth -- nations that are doing an unusually good job of protecting our most precious of rights as human beings -- principles such as life, liberty and the free pursuit of happiness.   In order to be effective in combating the identified threats to nobility and royalty and in promoting the immense potential for good that monarchy can create, we invite people everywhere to become members though donations to enable us to fulfill our important purposes.   To become fully operational, to accomplish our mission, to make a real difference in the world, we need your support. No one makes a salary in this organization. Everyone is a volunteer from the president on down. Every little amount contributed means that we can expand and enlarge our operations to measure up to the immense task that is before us. Your help is needed and wanted. **Please make the future brighter and contribute.**   **How to Identify a Scam and Thus Protect Yourself**   There are plenty of scammers or self-deceived people out there on the worldwide web. Part of our focus is on those selling fake titles or knighthoods or who impersonate what is real and genuine. Please see the articles "[**Fake Titles and Counterfeits**](id39.html "FAKE TITLES AND COUNTERFEITS")**,**" "[**Title of Nobility Scams**](id64.html "TITLE OF NOBILITY SCAMS")**,**" and "[**Orders of Chivalry**](id60.html "Orders of Chivalry")" for information on how to recognize if a person or organization is bogus or real.   In addition, if there is no real "**de jure**" sovereignty behind a self-proclaimed prince, then his or her claim is empty and fraudulent. The article "[**Sovereignty & The Future of Nobility and Royalty**](id31.html "SOVEREIGNTY, NOBILITY AND ROYALTY ")" and [**DEPOSED SOVEREIGNTY AND ROYALTY: how to preserve it and how to lose it**](the_sovereign_rights_of_deposed_kings__monarchs_and_sovereign_princes.html "DEPOSED SOVEREIGNTY AND ROYALTY: How to ")specifies the legal requirements necessary for an authentic claim under international law. If the self-proclaimed prince or order of chivalry does not square with the law regarding the preservation of sovereignty, the so-called prince or knighthood is a counterfeit or imitation. Other helpful markers are:   "**If the offer of an "****opportunity****" appears too good to be true, it probably is.**" Follow common business practice. For example, a legitimate business rarely conducts in cash on a street corner.  Know who you are dealing with. If you have not heard of a person, so-called prince or order of chivalry that you intend to do business with, learn more about them. Depending on the amount of money that you intend to spend, you may want to visit the business location, check with the Better Business Bureau or consult with your bank, an attorney, the police or the FBI fraud center.  Make sure you fully understand any business agreement that you enter into. If the terms are complex, have them reviewed by a competent attorney.  Be wary of businesses that operates out of post office boxes or mail drops and does not have a street address. Dealing with persons who do not a telephone line or are not licensed with the city and state in which they operate or have no other solid and reliable ways of contacting them are questionable.   Please see the articles: "[**Fake Titles and Counterfeits**](id39.html "FAKE TITLES AND COUNTERFEITS")" and "[**Title of Nobility Scams.**](id64.html "TITLE OF NOBILITY SCAMS")"   We have been members of two organizations to assure the public we are what we claim to be and do our best to be reliable, honest, sincere and true to our proclaimed purposes.   If you have questions about a self-proclaimed prince, royal or noble house, or order of chivalry, make inquiry, investigate them, do your homework, read the relevant articles, but please do not let yourself be taken in by any questionable operation no matter how authentic and genuine they present themselves to be. Remember that only the "**truth can make you free.**" (John 8:32) Free from very costly and humiliating mistakes.   **A Mark of Distinction**   Ethical conduct is a core value --- fundamental and basic to everything we stand for.   Our motto is "**built on solid evidence.**" In other words, we are an evidence based society. Everything must be factual, accurate and true. To do otherwise is to violate the whole purpose of our existence. We were created for the express purpose to promote the ideals of what is both true and real, as well as valid and authentic, in the important fields of monarchy, nobility and chivalry.   Our **Code of Conduct** provides essential guidelines and obligations to the highest standards of ethics. Not only to comply with the law and common decency, but in good faith to do our very best to be outstanding, cost/effective and reliable in all our dealings.   We have, therefore, as a business belonged to "**Chamber of Commerce on the Web**," which is "**The Seal of Integrity in Online Business**" for over eight years. "T**he Chamber of Commerce on the Web**" may be contacted at **admin@chamberofcommerce-ontheweb.com** (Chamber of Commerce, 2013: [**http://chamberofcommerce-ontheweb.com**](http://chamberofcommerce-ontheweb.com/ "http://chamberofcommerce-ontheweb.com"))   The sole purpose of our membership in the Chamber was to provide an environment in which a claimant or client could be confident, assured and correct in trusting us to do what we say we will do.   In addition to proving ourselves to be a business organization of integrity, while operating as a for-profit business, the Commission achieved the highest rating of an **"A+"** while we operated as a business through the "**Better Business Bureau®In Northern Nevada**." That is, on a scale of **A+ to F**, the commission received the following:   **"BBB® Non-Accredited A+ Rating"**   **This rating was based on 16 factors showing sustained general continuity, dependability and integrity for a long period of time. The BBB may be contacted at:** **info@reno.bbb.org**(Better Business Bureau, 2013: **http://www.bbb.org/reno/business-reviews/genealogy-services/the-international-commission-on-nobility-and-royalty-in-carson-city-nv-90004769**)   However, since the International Commission is no longer a business, but has downsized to a become a strictly voluntary service organization, continuing as a though we were a business, make no sense.  We will, of course, continue to serve the best that we can and uphold all our former standards for truth and integrity.  The positive honors we have achieved in the past will be continued. Ideals and ethics are important to us and will continue to be a guiding factor in all our decisions. It is central to all that we do.   **Articles on this Website**   Unless people can see the immense worth and value of monarchy, nobility and chivalry, which is far above silver and gold, these special and unique ideals will lose their edge and could eventually be lost to mankind. There are too many enemies and too much misinformation against monarchy for people to be objective. Nevertheless, knowledge of the true and real facts makes one powerful or empowered to be free from costly mistakes. The articles on this website are shared in order to safeguard the rights and privileges of the authenitc noble and royal houses that exist as well as protect the public from falsehoods were we can.
