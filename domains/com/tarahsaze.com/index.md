Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
--------------------------------

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consecteturLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Ut elit tellus, luctus nec ullamcorper mattis, pulvinar dapibus leo.adipiscing elit

Will SEO Help My Business Through Covid-19 Pandemic?

The short answer is: YES. How? Think about it, how the Coronavirus has changed the market place and how your customers buy from you will never be the same again. If your potential customers can’t find you in Google, chances are, they WILL NEVER buy from you! Regardless of how good your products or services are.  
SEO plays an important role when it comes to influencing the decision of your potential customers as they will always conduct their research before deciding on a purchase decision in Google. Even though they might have seen an ad in Facebook or Instagram.  
Investing in SEO for your business is one of the best decision you can ever make in 2020.

Which Offers Higher ROI - SEM or SEO?

SEM, or Search Engine Marketing, is often used to refer to Google’s paid ads which appear at the top and top right of most search results. You might wonder, why worry about organic SEO when you can just pay to be at the top?

Google Adwords (Google’s paid advertising platform) operates on a Pay-Per-Click basis, which means you have to pay for every single visitor to your website. Cost per click can range from $0.50 to $50 depending on your market. And remember, not every click is a new customer.

80% of search users admit to ignoring paid ads, which means you’re bidding against other advertisers for a relatively small share of the search market.

PPC is unforgiving; your ad must convert well, your landing page must be highly relevant, and your offer must entice your leads. Otherwise, you’re wasting money because you can’t control who can or who can’t click on your ads. For all I know, it could be your competitors, people who’re looking for work, people who click on your ad by accident, etc.

The cost-customer ratio for PPC remains linear, where proper SEO can yield exponential results.

In short, SEO takes longer, but it provides better results. There are benefits to both methods of ranking at the top of Google, and if you have the budget for both, that’s great! However, we’ll focus on SEO in this book because it ultimately provides the superior ROI.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit How Fast Will My Website Rank at the Top of Google?,

It depends on who you ask.

A typical SEO company would tell you 6 – 12 months because most of them don’t really know what they’re doing. That timeline gives them plenty of time to figure out what’s going on. Then, if you’re still not ranking after six months, who cares? They’ve already been paid for a six-month contract, so they’ll have no qualms about leaving you out to dry.

However, if you ask someone who actually knows what they’re doing, my answer would be 2 – 12 weeks.

I’d love to say it only takes a week to rank at the top of Google… In fact, I’ve ranked a brand-new website in 24 hours inside one of my case studies… But my legal advisor has recommended that I tell all of my clients 2 – 12 weeks for liability’s sake.

SEO can be much faster than most people realize, but it depends on your competitors and how aggressively they’re trying to take the top of Google. I’ve had clients triple their ROI by the 3rd month simply because no one else in their niche was doing proper SEO!

It should be noted that if your website has been penalized by Google, it’s going to take much longer to reach the top 3 results. This is because you’ll have to show Google that you’re a trustworthy website before they’ll rank you again.

How Does Google Decide which Website Ranks 1st?

This is the million-dollar question that everyone’s dying to answer, right? Knowing the answer to this question is the first step to a profitable SEO campaign. Fortunately, the answer is simple…

All of SEO eventually comes down to two things: **Authority and Relevance**.

Think about it – Google’s goal is to provide users with the best search experience possible. Common sense will tell you that a website that’s both authoritative (also read as: popular) within its niche and relevant to the user’s search should rank at the top.

**Authority** and **Relevance** = **On-page** and **Off-page SEO**

How Will Effective SEO Improve My Business?

Alright, alright, we know what [SEO](https://www.robin-ooi.com/) is, but how will it help your business? How will being at the top of Google lead to more customers or clients?

Let me answer that question with another: what if you had an automated salesperson that sent qualified leads to your business 24/7?

That’s what SEO can do for your business.

Remember how people used to flip open their Yellow Pages phonebook whenever they needed to find a business or service provider?

Well, Google is the new Yellow Pages, only it’s more interactive and user-friendly. Plus, it’s evolving to keep up with the needs of today’s customers. Your customers.

SEO Services Company Malaysia: We Succeed When You Succeed
----------------------------------------------------------

You have to be very careful when you select an SEO company Malaysia these days. This is because the search engines have gotten a lot smarter, and they even employ human beings to check competitive search results manually. That means that the old tactics of throwing a lot of cheap links at a website or spamming keywords do not work any longer. These tactics will not help your website, and they will probably even hurt it.

### How Are We Different Than Old-Fashioned SEO Companies?

We care about your business and your website because we thrive because visitors return to us again and again. We have experience in many business niches, and we know how to research the most effective sites to see what works in different industries. For example, the tactics we need to use for a local business website are different than the tactics that we will suggest for an international corporation. We won’t provide a one-size-fits-all solution, but we will provide you a customized program that will increase your rank at a very reasonable price. Instead of relying on the most rapid rise, we also focus on tactics that increase your rate at a steady and safe rate that will keep your website safe from the possibility of penalties.

### How Do We Achieve Great Search Engine Ranks?

There are three things that impact your rankings:

1. \* Your website content
2. \* The way your website is organized
3. \* Links and citations for your website

### 10ReasonsToInvestInOrganicSEOMalaysia

By focusing on improve your SEO scores in each of these three categories, we are able to move your site up. We may suggest content to take advantage of good terms that can earn you more business. We may suggest organizational changes to your website that will make it easier for search engine bots and human beings to find all of the pages of your site. Finally, we will search for quality sources of links and citations that will get your site site noticed by people and search engines in a positive way.

### How Will Effective SEO Improve My Business?

Alright, alright, we know what SEO is, but how will it help your business? How will being at the top of Google lead to more customers or clients?

Let me answer that question with another: what if you had an automated salesperson that sent qualified leads to your business 24/7?

That’s what SEO can do for your business.

Remember how people used to flip open their Yellow Pages phonebook whenever they needed to find a business or service provider?

Well, Google is the new Yellow Pages, only it’s more interactive and user-friendly. Plus, it’s evolving to keep up with the needs of today’s customers. Your customers.

Just in case you’re not convinced, here are some hard stats that demonstrate why SEO is important:

Whether you’re using Google AdWords (discussed below) or doing conventional SEO, the important part is that you’re at the top of Google. If you can’t be found in Google, you might as well not have a business!

What’s really interesting is how much traffic goes to the first three spots in Google. Look at the heatmap below to see why the top 3 spots are the most important:

In the image, the dark red indicates areas with an extremely high number of clicks, while the thick red line across the middle of the heatmap indicates the cutoff for “above the fold”.

Above the fold refers to the part of a page that people can see without scrolling down.

As you can see, only the first 3 to 5 results in the above image are visible without scrolling down. That’s why ranking in the top 3 results is so much better than ranking in spots 4 through 10, even though they’re all still on the first page. Statistically, the first result gets a whopping 20% of the traffic.

### Is SEO Just Another Fad?

You probably wouldn’t be here reading this book if you thought SEO was just another fad. But, just in case it needs to be clarified… No, it’s not.

SEO is the definitive inbound marketing method of the future. It allows you to create a steady stream of targeted traffic to your web site, which is literally invaluable.

If you already have a high-converting website, SEO will open up the floodgates and catapult your business to the next level. On the other hand, if your website is lackluster, but you have a steady offline business, then a successful SEO campaign will allow you to test and tweak your online sales funnel to perfection.

In either case, SEO allows you to successfully tap into the online portion of your niche’s market share in a cost-effective manner. Put simply, SEO has the potential for the greatest ROI of any other form of advertising.

Having said that, a poorly executed SEO campaign is like throwing money down the drain. Typically, a bad SEO campaign involves one of two problems:

1. You used questionable or outdated tactics to promote your website.

2. You’re optimizing for the wrong keywords; you’re either targeting the wrong customers, or your keywords don’t get enough search volume to be worth optimizing for.

Fortunately, by the end of this book you’ll know how to plan and carry out a highly effective SEO campaign, and how to avoid the most common pitfalls for beginning search marketers.

![Heatmap SEO Malaysia](https://www.robin-ooi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/HeatmapSEOMalaysia.png)Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is an essential aspect of digital marketing that can help businesses rank higher on Google search results. As a leading SEO company in Malaysia, we understand the importance of having a strong online presence in today’s competitive market. In this article, we will provide you with tips on how to outrank your competitors and rank higher on Google search results.

1. ### Conduct a thorough keyword research

Keyword research is the foundation of any successful SEO campaign. You need to identify the keywords and phrases that your target audience is searching for online. There are several tools you can use to conduct keyword research, such as Google Keyword Planner, SEMrush, Ahrefs, and Moz. Once you have identified the keywords and phrases, you can optimize your website content and metadata with them.

2. ### Optimize your website content

Your website content is the heart of your SEO campaign. You need to ensure that your content is high-quality, engaging, and informative. Make sure that your content is relevant to your target audience and optimized with your target keywords. Your website content should be unique, error-free, and easy to read. Additionally, you should also use header tags, such as H1, H2, and H3, to structure your content and make it more user-friendly.

3. ### Optimize your website metadata

Metadata is the information that appears in the search engine results pages (SERPs). This includes the title tag, meta description, and URL. You need to ensure that your metadata is optimized with your target keywords and provides a clear description of your website content. Your title tag should be no more than 60 characters, while your meta description should be no more than 155 characters.

4. ### Build high-quality backlinks

Backlinks are one of the most important ranking factors in SEO. A backlink is a link from another website to your website. You need to ensure that you have high-quality backlinks from authoritative websites in your industry. You can build backlinks by guest posting, broken link building, and by creating high-quality content that other websites will want to link to.

5. ### Use social media to promote your website

Social media can be a powerful tool for promoting your website and driving traffic to it. You can use social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn to share your website content and engage with your target audience. This can help you build brand awareness and attract new customers.

In conclusion, ranking higher on Google search results is essential for businesses that want to succeed in today’s digital age. By following these tips, you can improve your website’s SEO and outrank your competitors. Remember to conduct thorough keyword research, optimize your website content and metadata, build high-quality backlinks, and use social media to promote your website. With these strategies, you can achieve your SEO goals and drive more traffic to your website.
