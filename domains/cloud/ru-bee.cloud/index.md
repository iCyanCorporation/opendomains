RuBee (IEEE 1902.1) a magnetic alternative to RF and RFID, is a packet based wireless technology. RuBee tags are active, with a field proven 5-25 year battery life. RuBee is magnetic, not RF, so it works on steel and underwater. RuBee is designed for high security, high human safety, high intrinsic safety, high noise harsh environments. RuBee meets all of the Defense and Industrial Internet of Things requirements..

![Stacks Image 6822](files/stacks_image_6822.png)

  
RuBee tags can be attached or embedded into any steel product (jet engine, guidance system, structural aircraft parts). RuBee turns the steel into a high performance tuned antenna with 100% reliable read accuracy. These tags are not line-of-sight, can be read in a volume, and are intrinsically safe in highly explosive environments (see [Intrinsic Safety Tab](Academy/IntrinsicSafe/index.html "Intrinsic Safety")).

We Provide 100% Read Accuracy and Pedigree For Your Sensitive Items  
This One Minute Video Shows RuBee's Amazing Harsh Environment Performance

![Stacks Image 6819](files/stacks_image_6819.jpg)

  
  
Visible has over 1,800 installed RuBee Industrial and Defense sites worldwide with over thirty (30) million hours of problem free operation.   
  
  
Our Punch List:

![Stacks Image 5712](files/stacks_image_5712.png)

RuBee Tags have field proven battery life of 5 to 25 years, with range of 1 to 50 feet;

![Stacks Image 5852](files/stacks_image_5852.png)

RuBee Tags are sealed meet MILSTD 810G, and are waterproof to 5,000 feet;

![Stacks Image 21561](files/stacks_image_21561.png)

RuBee Tags have a CPU with optional sensors and memory;

![Stacks Image 5807](files/stacks_image_5807.png)

RuBee is the only wireless technology that is physically secure, with no Compromising Emanations and no Tempest, Target or Eavesdropping risk;

![Stacks Image 5759](files/stacks_image_5759.png)

RuBee is the only wireless technology that is safe near and on explosives with a zero Safe Separation Distance (SSD), RuBee is HERO ZERO and HERF ZERO;

![Stacks Image 5897](files/stacks_image_5897.png)

RuBee is Human Safe, classified by the FDA as a Class 1, Non Significant Risk (NSR) and about 1 million times below OSHA safe limits;

![Stacks Image 5987](files/stacks_image_5987.png)

Because RuBee is magnetic it works at 100% accuracy in harsh high steel and noise environments where RF is compromised.

![Stacks Image 5942](files/stacks_image_5942.png)

RuBee is the only wireless technology that provides 100% readability in harsh environments, not blocked by steel, liquids, dirt, snow or humans;
