New AWS generative AI innovations
---------------------------------

At re:Invent 2024, we launched new products, capabilities, and features that make it easier for you to adopt generative AI at scale.

* Amazon models
* Generative AI assistants
* Building applications
* Building models
* Responsible AI

### Introducing Amazon Nova

[Amazon Nova](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/nova/?hp=gat1) is a new generation of foundation models (FMs) with frontier intelligence and industry-leading price performance:

* Amazon Nova Micro, a text-only model that delivers the lowest latency responses at very low costs
* Amazon Nova Lite, a very low-cost multimodal model that quickly processes image, video, and text inputs
* Amazon Nova Pro, a highly capable multimodal model with the best combination of accuracy, speed, and cost
* Amazon Nova Canvas, a state-of-the-art image generation model
* Amazon Nova Reel, a state-of-the-art video generation model

This image was generated using Amazon Nova Canvas with the prompt "a portrait of a happy corgi dog”.

* Model distillation for cost-effective, task-specific inference
* Prompt routing and caching for cost-optimized generative AI applications
* Multi-agent collaboration for enhanced problem-solving
* Application development with Bedrock IDE in Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio

[Explore Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/?hp=gat1)

![Building applications](https://d1.awsstatic.com/Tab-5_aws-library_illustration_expertise_4_1200.c6a386fca4b89988e73707acbf1d6f72a6d81de9.png)

### Infrastructure to build, train, and customize AI models

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) [Trn2 instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/trn2/?hp=gat4) are the most powerful Amazon EC2 instances for generative AI training and inference. Powered by [AWS Trainium2](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/trainium/?hp=gat4) chips, Trn2 instances offer up to 40% better price performance the current GPU-based EC2 instances (P5e and P5en).

Three new [Amazon SageMaker HyperPod](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-ai/hyperpod/?hp=gat4) innovations make it easier for you to start building your own FMs for training some of today’s most popular models – saving you up to 40% of training time. You now have full visibility and control over compute resource allocation with task governance and flexible training plans efficiently use compute resources to accelerate model training time.

With Amazon SageMaker AI, you can now discover, deploy, and use fully managed generative AI and machine learning (ML) development applications from AWS Partners in [Amazon SageMaker Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-ai/studio/?hp=gat4). This integration helps you choose the tools that work best for you.

### Advancing trust in AI

We have a long-standing commitment to responsibly build and use AI to foster trust and deliver long-term value to our customers. We prioritize [responsible AI innovation](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/responsible-ai/?hp=gat2) and recently announced ISO/IEC 42001 accredited certification for our core AI services.

Here are some new responsible AI capabilities:

* Build trustworthy applications for high-stakes use cases with Automated Reasoning checks in Amazon Bedrock Guardrails
* Evaluate FMs and RAG applications against key safety and accuracy criteria by using the large language model (LLM)-as-a-judge capability
* Access new AI Service Cards for Amazon foundation models
