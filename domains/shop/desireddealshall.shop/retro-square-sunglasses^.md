Took a chance on this trendy style and found these sunglasses to be a great value. Even received compliments from teenagers!
These glasses were an ideal match for my costume! The color is spot-on, and they strike a great balance between being light and durable. While I wouldn't handle them recklessly, I wasn't worried about them breaking from an accidental drop. The lenses are tinted orange, adding to their appeal. Plus, the price is quite fair for both the item and its quality. Highly recommended!

These sunglasses have endured drops, toddler tugs, and everything else without a scratch. They're cute, stylish, and offer great sun protection. These glasses are not only fashionable, well-made, and affordable, but they also offer the unexpected benefit of deterring unwanted attention. As a frequent user of public transportation, I'm accustomed to being approached by strangers for various reasons, some of which can be quite intrusive. However, wearing these glasses seems to make me invisible to such disturbances, providing the perfect level of privacy I desired. This has been a pleasantly surprising advantage of my purchase. Strongly recommended!

In my view, these glasses are both stylish and of high quality. The frames feel solid, and the product matches its advertisement accurately. Having eyes that are sensitive to bright light, I was initially concerned that the lighter tint wouldn't suffice for all-day use. However, I was delighted to find that the sunlight didn't bother me at all while wearing them. It did take a moment to readjust to the natural color spectrum after removing them, which was an interesting experience, but I absolutely adore these shades!

Absolutely loving these sunglasses! They've quickly become my go-to shades for spring with their fantastic new color options. The quality is top-notch, and I highly recommend them. As someone who tends to lose sunglasses frequently, I wasn't expecting much for the price. However, these sunglasses exceeded my expectations in comfort and style. I loved them so much that I bought a pair for my daughters too!

These glasses feature lenses that are significantly darker than those of my usual driving pair, providing exceptional shade. They're also remarkably sturdy, so much so that sitting on them doesn't cause any damage, thanks to the thick material used. A major plus for the ladies: the design ensures that the sides don't catch and pull your hair, a relief given how often sunglasses can snag and tug at strands around the ears. Additionally, their flexible design allows them to double as a headband without discomfort, and they're compact enough to easily fit into a fanny pack.

Wasn't sure what to expect in terms of quality because of the price, but these sunglasses are just fine. Even my granddaughter approves, which is rare!

I’m so happy with these sunglasses. the retro square design is very fashionable and the lenses provide great sun protection. they’re lightweight and comfortable to wear all day. the quality is excellent and they feel very durable. i’ve gotten lots of compliments on them. highly recommend for anyone wanting stylish and functional sunglasses.

These sunglasses are incredibly cute and of excellent quality. They're also very comfortable, which is essential for me. There may be other vendors selling the same set for a higher price, but honestly, these are perfect as they are.
