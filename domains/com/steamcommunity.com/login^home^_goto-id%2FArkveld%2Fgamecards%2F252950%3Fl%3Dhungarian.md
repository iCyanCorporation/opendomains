Hello!

We see you're logging in to Steam from a new browser or a new computer. Or maybe it's just been a while...

Mistaken for spam?

Did you check your spam folder? If you don't see a recent message from Steam Support in your inbox, try looking there.

Success!

You now have access to your Steam account here.

Whoops!

Sorry but,   
that isn't quite right...

Let us help!

Sorry you're having trouble. We know your Steam account is valuable to you, and we're committed to helping you keep access to it in the right hands.

As an added account security measure, you’ll need to grant access to this browser by entering the special code we’ve just sent to your email address at .

If this is a public computer, be sure to log out of Steam when you're ready to quit this browser session.

Please contact Steam Support for assistance from a member of our staff. Legitimate claims for help with account access are our number one priority.

Hello !

This account is currently using a Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator.

Whoops!

Sorry but,   
that isn't quite right...

Let us help!

Sorry you're having trouble. We know your Steam account is valuable to you, and we're committed to helping you keep access to it in the right hands.

Confirm ownership of your account

We'll send a text message containing an account recovery code to your phone number ending in . Once you enter the code, we will remove the mobile authenticator from your account and you will receive Steam Guard codes via email.

Confirm ownership of your account

We have sent a text message containing a confirmation code to your phone number ending in . Enter the code below so we can remove the mobile authenticator from your account.

Whoops!

Sorry but,   
that isn't quite right...

Success!

We have removed the mobile authenticator from your account. Next time you log in, you will have to enter a Steam Guard code that is sent to your email address.

Success!

You can now use this device to get mobile authenticator codes for your account. Any other device that was previously providing authenticator codes for your account will no longer be able to do so.

Do you have the recovery code?

You do not have a phone number associated with your Steam account, so we are unable to verify account ownership via a text message. Do you have the recovery code that you wrote down when you added the mobile authenticator? The recovery code begins with the letter 'R'.

Enter your recovery code

Please enter the recovery code in the box below. The recovery code begins with the letter 'R'.

Whoops!

Sorry but,   
that isn't quite right...

Sorry!

Enter the current code displayed in the Steam Mobile app:

If you have lost your mobile device or uninstalled the Steam app and can no longer receive codes, then you may remove the mobile authenticator from your account. This will reduce the security on your account, so you should add a mobile authenticator to a new mobile device afterwards.

Please contact Steam Support for assistance from a member of our staff.
