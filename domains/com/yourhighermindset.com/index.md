Jenn, Business Owner &amp; CEO

I have been a single mom of six kids for the last nine years. I had a great upbringing growing up, but I had some sexual abuse in my childhood that was traumatic. The way it was managed led to a lot of self-sabotage and self-defeating patterns. I was able to be successful in the business world, but when it came to relationships, it was chaos; I aligned with being chaos junkie. And I wanted healing! I've sought healing using many different programs and thousands and thousands of dollars over 20 years. This particular program has really helped somatically, heal my nervous system.

I am now able to connect in my relationships, whether it's with my kids, my partner, or my business. I have been able to hold expansion and duality in my life in a way that has allowed me to just continue to evolve. In fact, because of these tools and how transformational it's been, I started my own company, being able to help others to achieve this as well. If this is something that you're thinking about, I highly encourage you, it's so life changing! If you want something different out of the relationships, if you want to see your business grow, your body change and transform, or you want your life and your family to just have something different, this is definitely the program and the tools for you!

Melissa, Entrepreneur/ Healer/Coach

The reason I joined this program is because I felt so stuck in life; I had gone through a lot of trauma and found myself in this cycle of growing and then self-sabotaging. My fibromyalgia would frequently get triggered and for the first time that I could remember, my ADHD was out of control. I was crashing, I was irritable. I knew my unresolved trauma was going to be there forever. I started going back into a therapy, but nothing was really hitting the place that needed to be hit. This program changed everything! I was able to discontinue that cycle of self-sabotage, double my sales in six months, and built a team to work for me in my business. I no longer have fibromyalgia symptom and my ADHD is once again my superpower, allowing me to build businesses and grow. For the first time in my life, I have experienced what it truly means to live in a state of healing, well-being, and peace.

I am now able to hike with my family again. My relationships with my family have changed tremendously; I have changed my generational legacy. I have finally been able to resolve those traumas that I thought would be part of me forever. I'm able to live anxiety free. If you are thinking, I don't have the time for that right now or I don't think I could afford that right now, you don't have the time to continue to waste in this short life that you're living. Don't waste another second. Living in these cycles, being overwhelmed by trauma, lashing out to your kids, and not understanding why you can't afford not to invest in yourself. You were called to break the cycle you were called. To break this trauma cycle you were called to change your generational legacy and when you do, you will find a tribe of people that have gone through the same fellow warriors that will rally next to you while you're taking those steps. It is so worth it. Invest in yourself now!

Dr. Cindy, MD/PhD/Business Owner/Transformational Health Coach

And when I found this program and these tools, I had been trying to retire from full time medicine and build an online transformational health coaching program to absolutely no avail. I had spent over $90,000 and I couldn't get a client. I could not show up for myself and do any of the work that I was supposed to do; I had major impostor syndrome. I didn't believe in myself and in addition to that, I was in a very loveless, toxic relationship for about 16 years. After going through this program, I was able to enroll 12 out of the next 13 people that booked enrollment calls with! I also left this very frustrating loveless relationship. And now I am so happy to say I have retired from full time medicine. I am paying this forward and teaching my children all these different tools that I've learned. I got certified so I am able to bring these tools to my clients as well. If you're on the fence about trying out this program, I would say run the walk and give it a shot. You will never regret it and you will live the best life you could ever live from here going forward!

Heather, Attorney &amp; Business Owner

Before I joined the program, I was really stuck, especially in my business. I had the sense that whatever I did was never going to be good enough. And I carried a lot of shame and was just really in this mode of paralysis, where I couldn't move forward. I was incredibly hard on myself, and I really felt like I needed to fix myself. It was really impacting my relationships with my family, especially my kids, because I was stressed out all the time, short tempered, and I really couldn't be present or really have fun or play. Since joining the program, I no longer have this sense that I need fixing. I gained the tools to heal. I have more self-acceptance, self-love, and compassion for myself. I'm more connected to who I am authentically and honestly, I feel liberated because I don't feel like I have to show up with these masks in order to feel good enough. I can now be playful and have fun with my kids and I can bring that sense of joy that I didn't have before. I can bring that into my business. So I one of the things that was most important to me was that I use these tools to create a sense of emotional safety, which I never knew I could do for myself before. Now I know how to communicate with myself and create that safety that allows me to show up in my business and show up as who I am. And I trust myself now I own my authority to make decisions that are right for me. And if you're thinking and joining the program, do it! These tools have been absolutely life changing for me, and they're going to change your life too!

Kim, LPC &amp; Life Coach

Before joining this program, I was angry all the time; striking out at anybody around me, just full of emotions and not knowing what to do with them. After three months in the program, I can now regulate and process my emotions. I'm not afraid of them anymore and it’s so exciting! There has been wonderful changes to me and also to my family. The biggest thing has been seeing how it's affected my relationships with my family members and with my clients. I'm a therapist and a life coach by trade. So it has been really exciting to see how things have been different for me. And if you are even remotely considering this program, I highly, highly, highly recommend it. I have tried all of the things I've done all these things and nothing worked. But this has changed my life. So go for it. I really encourage you to go for it.

Natalie, RN

Before I started this program, I was a mess. I thought if something were to happen to me, then I wouldn't necessarily be sad about it. I didn't know how to hold joy at all. And when I decided to get my healing I had negative $500 in my bank account. I entered into the program scared, absolutely terrified, As soon as I started, I knew this is exactly where I needed to be. I started to be able to think for the first time ever, like have this clarity and not just be totally overwhelmed as soon as I get up in the morning. And now I know what joy is and I can hold it. Because I've created my own safety, I can actually be present for my child. Six months after joining the program, I've made $70,000 in my business! The best part about this program is that you can create healing without needing anybody else’s help and that's the most amazing feeling in the entire world! I have internal peace every single day no matter what comes at me! If you're on the fence about this, DO IT. Just do it. It is going to change your life and your family's life and your future generation FOREVER. Just say YES!

I had the opportunity to work with Stacey not that long ago. She took me through a process that completely increased my confidence, and I felt like I had taken back my power! I have felt incredible ever since and have found myself doing things that used to scare me with ease! I absolutely love working with Stacey and highly recommend her to anyone who is looking to shift their mindset!
