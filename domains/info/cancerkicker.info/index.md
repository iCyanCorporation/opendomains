After 6 years of research I finally put together a short guide to help others from all I've learned about reversing cancer. I have experimented with everything I mention here and checked my progress with lab testing along the way. My life has completely changed and I have met many others with similar results...

Cancer can easily be stopped and reversed.

#### 12 ways to kill cancer

I started researching cancer 6 years ago when I found out I had a cyst on my liver. And, my girlfriend at the time was also diagnosed with cancer. First, I had a hip replaced in Olympia, WA in October 2017 then moved to New Orleans a few weeks later. In February 2018 my side was aching enough for me to visit the ER at the New Orleans VA hospital where I was told I had a cyst on my liver. OK what do I do? They said come back in six months for another scan. I made an appointment with Dr. Daigle, my primary doctor, to get some better answers. I was particularly repulsed by the non-response from my doctor who only tried to convince me it was a "normal" cyst I didn't need to worry about. I said wait a minute. Is it cancerous or not? We don't know. Just come back in 6 months for another scan. 6 months later there were 4 more cysts. The lack of care or response was mind-numbing. All of a sudden I have 5 cysts on my liver. Sounds like cancer to me. But not my doctor. He did not order any further lab tests, scans, or biopsy to prove to me it was not malignant. He just didn't give a shit. So I went to work online to figure out what to do about it, for me and my girlfriend. I found several approaches to dealing with cancer and its causes. You see, cancer results from cells dividing out of control. In order for this to happen a process called apoptosis must be shut down. It's the only way cancer can cells can survive. Our cells evolved to take themselves out after 50 divisions. After replicating 50 times mutations occur so for survival our cells are pre-programmed to die, cell suicide. You can put cancer cells in any healthy body and apoptosis will take them out. Apoptosis takes place when you sleep. It’s when your cells take the garbage out so if your sleep is trashed your cells fill with trash. You MUST sleep well or else. If you don't, apoptosis shuts down and cells mutate into cancer. To help sleep better you could take 1mg of melatonin 90 minutes before sleep time. The natural way to get melatonin is by getting sun in the daytime when your body makes it. Your brain releases it after dark. It is necessary to stay off all screens after dark including phones, TV, computer, and all indoor LED lights. Why? Naturally, when the sun goes down and darkness covers your eyes is when your brain switches on melatonin. The brightness of LED screens and lights are so bright that your brain thinks it is noon and shuts off your melatonin like a switch. LEDs are so bright and toxic that they also cause cancer. Numerous studies have proven this; 1."Induction of Skin Cancer by Long-Term Blue Light Irradiation" at <https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/11/8/2321> and 

2. "Evening home lighting adversely impacts the circadian system and sleep" at 

<https://.www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-75622-4>

If it's not possible to go dark after sunset then use blue blocking glasses to block the glare. I have used glasses from Luciaeyes.com and RAoptics. At home I light candles instead of lighting. It's much easier on the eyes and doesn't trash melatonin like LEDs.  
    I learned from Jack Kruse MD exactly how important it is to get sun at precise times of the day. Apoptosis is controlled by UV light. The more sun you get the better you sleep. 

It is a medical fact that the areas of your body that receive the least amount of sun have the highest occurrence of melanoma, skin cancer. When you search the medical literature you will find that patients with melanoma have low vitamin D which proves what I just said.

A word from Dr Kruse on skin cancer, "Sunglasses are cellular suicide. On a sunny day, specific wavelengths of light filter into the eyes. This feeds the pineal and pituitary glands and lets the brain know it's sunny out. The skin then prepares for direct sunlight and gets ready to make vitamin D. Wearing sunglasses starves the pineal gland and tricks the brain into thinking it's cloudy out, which stops the skin from preparing for sun exposure. This is one of the main reasons people get skin cancer. Not because of sun but because of sunglasses."

\*Diet   
One of the main dietary causes of cancer comes from a type of hydrogen you've probably never heard of. We have two types of hydrogen in our food and water. One makes you thin and healthy, the other makes you fat and sick. First, a short science lesson; Protium is light hydrogen. It is the one that makes everything inside your cells run smoothly. Deuterium is heavy hydrogen. It makes you fat and sick and directly causes cancer. Too much deuterium in your body causes your cells to divide out of control, cancer. It is a wrecking ball inside the most important parts your cells. So how do we lower deuterium? Easy. The easiest way is to eat foods low in deuterium. Fats are lowest in deuterium. Carbs and sugars are the highest in deuterium which is why fruits and vegetables can be highly toxic depending how much deuterium is in them. Also certain supplements are so high in deuterium that they contain double a day's worth of deuterium that you would be getting from your diet. Chickens, cows and fish that are fed corn, soy or other vegetables high in deuterium pass on the deuterium to you when you eat it. Make sense? In fact, chickens are NOT vegetarians. They eat low deuterium bugs. Cows are not designed to eat corn either. They naturally eat low deuterium grass. Fish are not vegetarians either. Feed-lot cattle, warehoused chickens and farmed fish are fed crap like corn and soy, crammed into filthy living conditions and filled with antibiotics and steroids. The healthiest sources of meats are from animals on their natural diet in their natural environment; such as pasture raised cows, pastured chickens and wild caught fish provide the healthiest meats lowest in deuterium. Deuterium also makes these animals sick and when you eat sick animals it makes you sick too, from the deuterium and every other toxic thing in that animal. You are what you eat (and what that animal ate as well). Every farmer knows how to make an animal fat. Feed it corn. It works great on humans too.  
 I just saw a star-filled commercial pushing "heart healthy" plant based meat. I was instantly compelled to educate myself on exactly which ingredients fake meat is made of and I found not one ingredient I would put in my body. Namely, hexane (a neurotoxin), Red #3 (banned in cosmetics), caramel color (gives cancer to rats), sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP is a neurotoxin, a registered pesticide and air contaminant), tertiary butylhydroquinone (liver enlargement and paralysis). Heme gives these frankenburgers the flavor and GMO soy tastes similar. The main ingredient is SLH, Soy LegHemoglobin, which is not even a food. 1/4 of this heme ingredient has 46 different proteins, some unidentified and none assessed for your safety. A look at the numbers tells the true story. It costs $7.63 to produce a pound of grass fed beef. It costs 25 cents per pound of soy meal. Grass fed beef retails for $8-10.50/pound. "Impossible" frankenburgers retail for around $9.32. That is such a ridiculously high markup. I mean, what a scam! Hell, I would get in on it too if I knew it wasn't going to destroy everyone's health. This is why I cringe every time I hear the term "heart healthy". Our clever marketing firms really know how to pull one over on us don't they? Just hire an actor/comedian/sport star to say how great it is and sprinkle it with environmental guilt and every unsuspecting fool will feel so great about the toxic crap they're stuffing in their mouths. Brace yourself for the oncoming health disaster.

Cholesterol levels tell you if you're in cancer's reach. Low cholesterol is a bad sign. See this video on X: <https://x.com/ronin19217435/status/1815188680262218014>

\*Sugar   
Why does sugar fuel cancer?  Cancer cells are well known for having an immense uptake of glucose, and typically use glucose 200 times quicker than normal cells (the Warburg effect). Cancer cells have a completely different metabolism than healthy cells. Cancer cells can't use fat because there is no Krebs cycle. A normal cell takes 1 unit of glucose to make 98 pounds of energy. A cancer cell fed 1 unit of glucose only makes 2 pounds of energy, so it has to rob all the nutrients from healthy cells. They shut everything else down. You need to treat the cancer cells different. Make them weak and make normal cells strong.  A diet with healthy fats is a requirement of dealing with cancer. It starves cancer cells and feeds good healthy cells. I said good fats not junk food fat. Ghee butter, coconut oil, olive oil are great sources of fat. We all need to avoid PUFAs polyunsaturated fats and by now I think we all, no matter how illiterate, know trans fats are really bad. A great source of info along these lines can be found in Dr. Steven Gundry's book The Plant Paradox.(4) He is the master of gut health. Gut health is a very high priority and not to be taken lightly. It IS your health! I gave his diet a serious trial and had amazing results within 2-3 weeks. I lost 15 pounds and people were telling me my skin had cleared up. I was only trying to reduce inflammation which I did. The weight loss was just a nice bonus. I did it without one minute of exercise. You see, I was unable to exercise that year. I was recovering from a hip replacement and I had my fourth and final back surgery. 

With sugar and carbs comes high amounts of deuterium. The best way to directly lower deuterium is drinking deuterium depleted water. This water has had the deuterium removed from it and drinking it will dilute the deuterium in your body. It's a very effective way of preventing cancer, or if you have cancer already has been proven to reduce tumor size and stop spreading of cancer cells. In early stages of cancer you can nuke cancer cells with radiation or chemo to make them go away completely. In later stages, when it's too late for that you can live with the cancer you have but keep it under control. It's a relatively new approach and the main stream of medicine has not caught up to it yet. It's available on Amazon in the US. There are two excellent books by Dr. Gabor Somlyai on the subject. 3. Deuterium Depletion: A New Way in Curing Cancer and Preserving Health, and 3. Defeating Cancer!: The Biological Effect of Deuterium Depletion. I met Dr. Gabor in June when I traveled to Budapest and I think he's a cool dude. In his book Deuterium Depletion, he states, "... in patients in remission, deuterium depletion can prevent Ithe recurrence of the disease by 90%." If you want to consult with an expert on deuterium protocols then reach out to the team at DDCenters.com for that information. You can order a test kit from them  to find your deuterium level and monitor your deuterium intake to adjust your level of deuterium (and your level of disease). If they're out of stock you can also order test kits from drinklitewater.com

If you want to learn more about deuterium here is a plain english explanation by an expert, Dr. Que Collins

HBOT HyperBaric Oxygen Treatment

From "The Oxygen Revolution" by Dr. Paul G. Harch

"Radiation therapy for cancer is based on the ability to generate highly reactive chemicals called free radicals that rapidly react with tissue, especially tissue that is dividing and multiplying like cancer. This process is dependent on oxygen levels: the lower the oxygen levels in the tumor, the lower the killing effect of radiation on the cancer. Conversely, the higher the oxygen level, the more cancer is killed. HBOT is the best way to achieve the highest levels of oxygen in cancer. In fact, in the 1970s, a radiation oncologist in New Orleans demonstrated preliminary clinical studies showing a synergistic effect of radiation and HBOT on cancer. With this kind of synergistic effect, we demonstrate that sometimes, 1 + 1 = 3. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, doctors in Japan picked up the torch and applied HBOT plus radiation to patients with the most deadly type of brain cancer. The average life expectancy of these patients nearly doubled, from 13 months to 22 months.

More recent research has suggested that HBOT may also decrease the side effects of chemotherapy. An animal study in 2008 showed that when HBOT was administered with a chemotherapeutic agent known to permanently damage the heart, the heart damage was markedly reduced. I saw this potential for HBOT reinforced by a similar effect in a friend and colleague of mine. Ken Locklear is an ex-Navy diver, a hyperbaric technician, publisher, and hyperbaric services business owner/provider. He’s also a co-founder of the IHMA, along with Dr. Duncan and me. He was stricken with Stage IV metastatic colon cancer nearly three years ago at the age of 37. His life expectancy was about six months. Ken underwent surgery, after which he began chemotherapy. However, after he scoured the medical literature on HBOT in cancer, he discovered articles from the 1950s suggesting that HBOT may have a role in cancer treatment. Ken began HBOT during his chemotherapy, and not only did the cancer become undetectable in four months, he experienced none of the nausea, vomiting, hair loss, peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage in the extremities), and low red and white blood cell counts or platelet counts. He was even able to maintain and even expand his businesses, and he and his wife had a child during this time. The HBOT was so successful in reducing these typical side effects that his oncologist significantly increased the doses of his chemotherapy and gave him over one and a half times the number of treatments with the most toxic chemotherapeutic agent. Ken subsequently has been granted a patent to use HBOT to minimize side effects of chemotherapy in cancer. He is currently funding animal research in an attempt to duplicate his experience. Unfortunately, after the cancer disappeared and Ken stopped chemotherapy and HBOT, the cancer returned. He has reinstated the HBOT and chemotherapy and he is again controlling symptoms and growth, and possibly reducing the size of the cancer. He is making cancer a chronic disease, much like AIDS has become for many people over the last two decades. Obviously, I hope to post on my website another positive addendum to Ken’s story. In the meantime, Ken and I are compiling a resource containing scientific articles on HBOT in cancer treatment.

More recently, Dr. Dominic D’Agostino and his colleagues at the University of South Florida combined the high oxygen environment of HBOT with a diet that had no carbohydrates (sugar) to treat mice with widespread metastatic cancer2. While the HBOT had no effect on cancer progression, the combination of HBOT with this diet, the ketogenic diet, increased average survival time in the mice by nearly 80 percent. In other words, it nearly doubled the lifespan of the cancer-ridden mice. The combination of removing the low oxygen environment that promotes growth of cancer, along with a diet that starved the cancer of its food source, had a significant effect. The diet therapy alone is similar to elemental diets recommended for humans with cancer. Imagine combining these simple non-toxic treatments to treat people with cancer—what an exciting future for cancer treatment, especially with the addition of chemo or radiation."  
  
Another sure way to greatly reduce your chances of being overcome with cancer is to reduce your exposure to electrosmog. The radiation from all wireless devices like phones, wifi, bluetooth, cellular towers, earbuds and radio transmitters are today's silent slow killers. You can't see it, smell it, touch it but it is very real. Trust me. The effects of wireless and electromagnetic radiation are very well documented in Dr. Becker's book, The Body Electric.(10) He was an orthopaedic surgeon that did lots of research into how the body's electric system works. His books were required reading for medical students. As a matter of fact, he worked in the same medical school my parents attended. He was primarily interested in using electricity to help regrow amputated limbs. In the process he discovered how disruptive to our natural electric system radiation from the electric grid and wireless frequencies are. Most of this research started in the 1960s by Russian scientists. Mountains of research was discovered in Russia proving cancer is caused by electrical and radio frequencies. A great example is my girlfriend Kim, a hair stylist. To keep her hands free while cutting hair she kept her cell phone tucked in her bra so she could always be ready to book appointments while cutting hair. For years she put it in the same exact place. She developed breast cancer in that area. You see, a cell phone's antenna is positioned along the sides of the phone, forming an L shape. She also had a L-shaped cancer on her left tit. The tit was unfortunately removed. I, for almost 30 years, kept a cell phone in my left pocket and used my left hand to hold it and put it up to my left ear. This microwave radiation dries out your cells just like cooking a steak in a microwave, which just dries out into a tough piece of leather. Likewise, the cartilage in my left hip disappeared because of this. Where my phone sat in my left pocket is directly on top of my hip joint. Also the CPC joint in my left hand is toast. It's the joint connecting the thumb to the palm. Now I can barely open a jar with my left hand. A SPECT scan of my brain in 2018 showed lowered/no activity or low blood flow in the left temporal lobe, clearly brain damage. This is where a cell phone emits radiation into your skull. Shortly after this scan I learned not to put cell phones to my head and a year later I returned for another SPECT scan. It showed improved blood flow and activity where there had been none. Unfortunately my left hip had already been replaced.  
These effects are even more dramatic in children. The younger they are the more damaging it is. Children's nerves are not myelinated so there is no barrier to protect their nerves. And pets are not immune from it either. Last year I lost my two favorite dogs to cancer, and both of them had owners that refused to turn off wifi routers at night. You see, the dogs slept next to them and were slowly microwaved to death. It's a slow boil. Like, how do you boil a frog? If you put it in boiling water it will jump out. If you put it in the water and slowly increase the temperature it will blissfully sit until its boiled. We're on the same slow boil. If you start to wonder why “they” don't do something about it, these questions are best answered in Dr. Andrew Marino's book, Going Somewhere,(11) an excellent read. Dr. Marino also worked in my parents’ medical school.  
  
Sometimes the answer to solving your cancer requires you to change locations. For example, 3 years ago I spoke with a doctor in Peru who asked what I think he should tell his cancer patient. After a few questions about their living environment I discovered they live in a highly dense populated area in town. The answer was simple. They need to move out of that area to a less densely populated area out of town and away from all the electrosmog. They listened to him and moved. When I followed up a year later they were alive and doing well. You see, when you're packed into a city in an apartment building or condo you have radiation from everyone else on top of you, next to you, below you... This wireless radiation goes through walls, floors, glass. What can you do? Give yourself plenty of distance from radiation sources and in your own living environment turn off all wireless devices; wifi, phones, printers, computers, TVs when you're not using them, especially at night when you're sleeping. Never never never keep a wifi router in your bedroom and if you just have to have a phone in your bedroom at least put it in airplane mode. It still radiates even when you're not using it so if you use it for an alarm or for music just put it in airplane mode. My girlfriend in New Orleans had extremely high readings in her house. My RF meter showed extremely high numbers, and there was extremely high readings on my dirty electricity meter as well. She lived in a 4plex with 4 "smart" meters on her side of the building, and it was only a block from the nearest cell tower. She was on her phone all day and night in a room with a wifi router. I told her she really needs to move but she said she wouldn't possibly give up her cute little place in the famous Treme neighborhood of New Orleans. Unfortunately she only lived a couple years after surgery  and chemo . I have no doubt that she would have lived if she would have moved. She was the most resistant to change of all the people I know. She didn't want to change anything and she did not live. It was like trying to drag someone uphill to get her to even try something different. Many times, I found myself asking her do you want to live or do you want to die? It was such a toxic environment that one of her dogs also died from cancer.   
 Whenever I travel or search for a new place to live I bring a few meters with me to test the rooms inside and the area outside. I test for radio frequency radiation, electromagnetic frequencies, electric fields, dirty electricity, and wire grounding. You can also hire a technician to do this for you. Two years ago I gave a consultation at the vacation house of a man from Canada. His house is located on the Mexican island of Isla Mujeres. I brought all my meters for testing his house; an RF meter for testing wireless radiation, a trifield meter for RF, EMF (electromagnetic), and EF electric fields; a dirty electricity meter to test "smart" meter radiation in the house wiring and a couple other gadgets. He has prostate cancer with symptoms that flare up at times. We talked for a while as I went around his house with my meters. He was breaking my #1 rule. There was a router on his night stand just two feet from his body at night. I said "dude this needs to go immediately, like stop everything and get it done today." Why? It's as cancerous as smoking 3 packs a day. After an hour we sat down outside to talk and he mentioned how much he likes to ride motorcycles and how many motorcycles he has. Six. It was at that moment I realized exactly what is causing his prostate problems. I said "You're not going to like me after I tell you this but I just figured out your prostate problems. It's your motorcycles." I also used a motorcycle to scoot around the island and tested it for electromagnetic fields. It had a high EMF reading when I put the meter on the seat. The battery and wiring is directly under the seat. So I tested his motorcycle with a meter to show him. I noticed it had a Canadian license plate and asked if he rode it down from Canada. It took two weeks to ride all the way from British Columbia. By the time he arrived his prostate problems flared up to the point he was in enough pain and misery that he had to run to the doctor for help. It wasn't from an uncomfortable seat. It was from sitting on top of a high magnetic field all day every day for two straight weeks.  
  An excellent discovery by Dr. Martin Pall proves when you're exposed to electromagnetic fields you instantly have a stress reaction which floods your cells with calcium. Naturally, under stress, your cell's calcium gates open, flooding your cells with calcium. Calcium is excitatory, stressful. These unnatural frequencies open your VGCCs (voltage gated calcium channels) and calcium pours all over your body. It affects the way DNA replicates, causing mutations which develop into cancers. It’s an overload of your natural processes.  See Dr Pall's youtube video (5) <https://youtu.be/0RIskTMLV40?si=rNuYZLN8RCdwwyrp> Every person I know that has a wifi router next to their bed or close to them at work all day, or both, are very ill. These people are usually smokers/drinkers/pill users. They need something to calm down, take the edge off. I was trying to explain this to one of them and all he wanted to do is argue. He had a cigarette in one hand and a beer in the other. He's telling me "I'm not buying that" as he's taking a drag off his smoke. This is one minute after he was complaining about running out of blood pressure medicine. "There's nothing wrong with me", chugging down his beer. "I have a router AND my phone stays on next to my bed"!  He scoffed when I suggested to at least turn it off at night, like reaching over to push a button is such an immense effort. At bedtime one of the last things you do is turn off your lights so what's the big deal about flipping one more switch? If you can't be bothered to at least turn the damn thing off to save your life then what am I wasting my breath for? I ended the argument with ok enjoy your cancer and your heart disease.   
Plenty of information on this topic is available in the National Library of Medicine. This abstract "Influence of electric, magnetic, and electromagnetic fields on the circadian system: current stage of knowledge" (21) contains references to 159 other studies on the same topic. So study away if you need more convincing that this is a serious hazard.  
  
A few years ago I read a series of books titled The Law of One (6) and discovered something about cancer I never would have thought of. Since I try to use every approach I can to deal with cancer I must include this too. The books are written in a question and answer format. I'll quote book two starting with an answer:  
“...It is this influence which has begun to cause thoughts to become things. As an example you may observe the thoughts of anger becoming those cells of the physical bodily complex going out of control to become what you call the cancer.  
Questioner: You mentioned that the thoughts of anger are now causing cancer. Can you expand on this mechanism as it acts as a catalyst or its complete purpose?  
Answer: The fourth density is one of revealed information. Selves are not hidden to self or other-selves. The imbalances or distortions which are of a destructive nature show, therefore, in more obvious ways, the vehicle of the mind/body/spirit complex thus acting as a teaching resource for self revelation. These illnesses such as cancer are correspondingly very amenable to self-healing once the mechanism of the destructive influence has been grasped by the individual.  
Questioner: Then you are saying then that cancer is quite easily healed mentally and is a good teaching tool because it is easily healed mentally and once the entity forgives the other-self at whom he is angry the cancer will disappear. Is this correct?  
Answer: This is partially correct. The other portion of healing has to do with forgiveness of self and a greatly heightened respect for the self. This may conveniently be expressed by taking care in dietary matters. This is quite frequently a part of the healing and forgiveness process. Your basic premise is correct.”  
At the time I first read this I was harboring a seething anger towards my mother and stepfather. I refused to speak to them or respond to messages for years. I determined never to speak to them again. So when I read this session I realized I would be better off to let it go and stop carrying the anger around before it kills me. When I finally did it was a relief, and my mother was glad to hear from me. Since then, when I consult people about their cancerous loved ones I ask if this person is angry for any reason. The answer is usually yes very angry.  
  
     Finally, a few simple ways to battle cancer cells that anybody can afford: CBD, fenbendazole, Vitamin E, B17, honey, and iodine. The first three used together are very effective 

\* CBD helps apoptosis by activating protein family BCL-2 which regulates apoptosis. I read this in a blog by neurosurgeon Jack Kruse, MD.

\*Fenbendazole has always been used for veterinary reasons but was discovered to have strong anti-tumor properties. It induces apoptosis,  restricts glucose feeding and revives the P53 gene (the bodies strongest tumor suppressor). This website explains the use of Fenben for cancerhttps://alternativemedicine.com/cancer/facts-you-might-not-have-known-about-fenbendazole/

\* Vitamin E, "Experimental studies have also determined that the intracellular mechanisms mediating the apoptotic effects of specific vitamin E compounds display great diversity in different types of caner cells and has been found to restore multidrug resistant tumor cells sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents. These findings strongly suggest that some natural and synthetic analogues of vitamin E can be used effectively as anticancer therapy either alone or in combination to enhance the therapeutic efficacy and reduce toxicity of other anticancer agents."

\* Melipona honey specifically from the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico. A recent study in patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment for head and neck cancer observed the effects of consuming melipona honey on [*Streptococcus mutans*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_mutans), a type of bacteria responsible for sore throats.

Interestingly, researchers found a significant decrease in *Streptococcus mutans* after they consumed melipona honey.

Moreover, melipona honey decreases harmful oral bacteria that causes [mucositis](https://medlineplus.gov/spanish/ency/patientinstructions/000047.htm), a common side effect of radiation and chemotherapy. Mucositis results in inflammation and painful ulcerations of the mucous membranes lining the [esophagus](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/picture-of-the-esophagus) and digestive tract.  
\* Vitamin B17 is another option. \*\*\*First, I must warn about this. It sends your immune system into high alert. It is something I tried but have since put back on the shelf.\*\*\*  B17 is a name for amygdalin. It's used to make a chemical named laetrile. Laetrile releases cyanide causing apoptosis in cancer cells. B17 is found in bitter apricot seeds. $26/pound on Amazon. I eat two or three seeds a day. Do not eat more than three seeds per day. The idea has been promoted for several types of cancer such as prostate, breast, cervical, bladder, lung, kidney.   
In 2021, researchers found the mechanisms of how amygdalin induces apoptosis: it increased one protein and reduced another. They said "amygdalin posseses anticancer properties and induces apoptosis", and that" amygdalin can act as a multi-functional drug in cancer therapeutics." source 7: Al-Khafaji k, Taskin Tok T."Understanding the mechanism of amygdalin's multi-functional anticancer function using computational approach. J Biomol Struct Dyn. 2021; 39(5):1600-1610   doi: 10.1080107 391102.2020.1736159  
In August 2020, researchers said they demonstrated that amygdalin can kill certain breast cancer cell lines and that amygdalin may prevent those cells from spreading through the body. They also stated that it was not toxic to healthy skin cells. source 8: Mosayyebi B, Mohammadi L, Kalantary-Charradeh A, Rahmati M. "Amygdalin decreases adhesion and migration of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines [published online ahead of print, 2020 Aug 10]. Curr Mol Pharmacol. doi: 10.2174/1874467213666200810141251  
In June 2020, researchers combined amygdalin with an enzyme called beta-glucosidase (B-glu), which enhances amygdalin activity. They found that the combination lead to the death of prostate cancer cells. They also noted that while the treatment had some impact on heart and liver function, it did not appear to cause organ damage. source 9: Zhou J, Hou J, Rao J, Zhou C, Liu Y, Gao W. "Magnetically directed enzyme/prodrug prostrate cancer therapy based on B-Glucosidase/amygdalin" Int J Nanomedicine. 2020; 15:4639-4657. Published 2020 June 29 doi: 10.2147/IJN.S242359  
  
\* Iodine. In laboratory tests, iodine has been shown to kill cancer cells and it acts in the body to enhance the immune system in its search for rogue and pre-cancer cells. Indeed, iodine deficiency is known to cause pre-cancerous fibrocystic disease, which can lead to breast cancer. Iodine supplementation can maintain breast health; prostate cancer and colorectal cancer patients have also clear and recorded benefits from the supplementation of iodine. Radioactive iodine is used to identify thyroid cancer and has been used in the treatment of thyroid cancer since the early 1940s.

\* Breast Cancer and iodine  
In early demographic studies (12), it was noted that in regions of low iodine consumption, women had higher rates of  breast cancer, and in regions of higher iodine consumption, women had lower rates of breast cancer. In laboratory tests, iodine has been shown to kill cancer cells and it acts in the body to enhance the immune system in its search for rogue and pre-cancer cells. Indeed, iodine deficiency is known to cause pre-cancerous fibrocystic disease, which can lead to breast cancer. Iodine supplementation can maintain breast health. Three clinical trials confirm this (13).  
Dr. B.A. Eskin published more than 80 papers over a 30 year period showing that iodine deficiency was linked with an increased risk of both breast and thyroid cancer (14).  
In rats, a group allowed free access to iodine had 37.5% less breast cancers than the group without such access. In another Eskin study, this time with Stoddard, iodine was shown to inhibit the binding to estrogen receptors and affect 43 genes involved in cell growth. Eskin showed that iodine altered gene expression and effected apoptosis (15).  
\* Prostate Cancer  
Thyroid disease is associated with an increased prostate cancer risk (16). Iodine is concentrated in the prostate and is linked to the health of the organ according to the Canadian study. There were 29% less prostate cases in the group with high iodine, when compared with those men with low iodine.  
Research has shown that prostate cancer cells take up iodine easily and it can cause apoptosis (17).  
\* Lung Cancer  
Known to clear lung and airway congestion and even aid asthma sufferers, several studies have shown that supplementary iodine can increase apoptosis of lung cancer cells. Iodine has been tested with numerous cancer cell lines such as gliomas, pancreatic cancer and lung cancers. Studies have shown that iodine can inhibit growth and spread of cancer cell lines in vitro.  
In 2021 research, lung cancer tumors with low average iodine density showed a greater risk of recurrence in human subjects (18).  
\* Colorectal and stomach cancers  
People with Goiter are more than twice as likely to develop colorectal cancer as those without the disease.  
A bile component, arachadonic acid, is known to be linked to an increased risk of colorectal cancer. Iodine can bind to, and neutralise, this acid.  
In the case of stomach cancer, urine samples showed that 49 per cent of patients had severe iodine deficiency (19).  
In an epidemiology study, the use of iodized salt in Poland resulted in a marked decline in gastric cancers (20).  
  
Personally, I learned from Dr. Kruse that shrimp tails (the crunchy part) contain high doses of natural iodine. Now I leave the tail on the end of my shrimp when I eat shrimp. Also, I use iodized sea salt which I can only find on amazon now. Natural sources include sea vegetables (like kelp, arame, wakame, hiziki and kombu), oysters, prawns, crab, mussels, sea fish, organic strawberries, cranberries, eggs, cheese. Kelp is the highest in natural iodine.  
The best thing I learned from Dr. Kruse is how to use the sun to keep disease away. That's right, the sun. And best of all it's free. His explanations are on the technical side but when it comes to cancer the simplest way I can explain it is the body parts that never get sun are the most likely to get cancer. Why? As you know, cancer cells are cells dividing out of control. The sun slows the cells down. His patients and followers are encouraged to get sun at precise times of day to maximize the sun's nourishment of the entire body. He has many youtube videos as well as a website and a book Epi-Paleo RX.(2) Recently, Dr. Kruse was interviewed by Logan Duvall on the subject of cancer and this video is a must-see! <https://youtu.be/B8VcGXbKR34?si=6v_s3FEd7kcfVJsV>  
  
History  
In the 1930s Alton Ochsner, Sr. was in medical school. In the middle of the night he and other students were woken from their dorm room beds and rushed to see something extremely rare, an autopsy ofa patient with lung cancer. The professor said they were dragged out of bed to witness this cancer because it was likely they would never see it again for the rest of their medical career. Alton Ochsner Sr. was an American surgeon and medical researcher who worked at Tulane University and other New Orleans hospitals before he established The Ochsner Clinic. Now known as Ochsner Medical Center, the clinic is the flagship hospital of Ochsner Health System in New Orleans.  
This was at a time when most people worked outside all day in the sun yet there was no skin cancer. They were thin, tan and healthier than all of us today. So what has changed in the last 90 years that made cancer explode? One reason is, we are so removed from the nature we evolved in that our bodies are rejecting it. We are soaked in toxic unnatural light at all hours of the night and day, bathed in an ocean of electrosmog from wireless technology, and eat a contaminated food supply. And, the only publicly available options for the vast medical issues resulting from it all is our allopathic medical system. In this approach to medicine there is no prevention, only pills and surgeries AFTER you've become diseased. Our allopathic medical system is a profit based system that shames any other approach to healing. You see, doctors get in no trouble when a patient is harmed as long as the "standard of care" was being followed. Your doctor gets in trouble when something harms a patient when treated other than by following the "standard of care". Only the most profitable pills, procedures, and surgeries are allowed. Cancer is big business. In fact, it's their biggest money maker. For that matter, don't expect your typical lab-coat doctor to approve everything in this report. I'm not saying you should disregard advice from your doctor. Just know some of the things I've mentioned here are simply too far ahead of conventional medicine for it to be accepted by the main stream yet. Most of them mean well and some of them are catching on. They're just in a crummy greedy system.  
  
Diseases including cancer are easily stopped and even completely reversed IF you CHANGE. We have a saying in our medical community, "You will not get well in the same environment you got sick in" Make sense? When I changed my diet I lost 15 pounds. When I got rid of all the toxic lighting in my house, started wearing blueblocking glasses at night and using the sunrise to set my circadium rhythm; and when I minimized all the electrosmog in my life is when I lost another 15 pounds. I also stopped the arthritis that was eating up my spine. With the inflammation gone, I was not in pain any more and was able to get off the opiates I depended on for 9 years. It works not only  for me but everyone else I've met in the quantum health community. There are thousands of people like me that found a way to reverse disease. All you need to do is make the effort to at least try something different. I tried everything possible. I ate apricot seeds, kelp, shrimp tails, iodized salt, deuterium depleted water. I stopped eating/drinking sugar. Now, I rarely miss a sunrise and get plenty of sun. I strictly limit the electrosmog and the toxic lighting in my life. Sometimes the causes of disease come from more than one source and when you're really sick you'll do anything to make it better. When it works you'll have no problem adopting these new habits.  
  
As a seasonal reminder: It's winter. Days are shorter. Harvests are over. Not very long ago, before electricity and shipping made it possible to provide fruit anywhere in the world at any time of the year, we lived in a completely different reality. At a certain point you ran out of fresh fruits and vegetables. The ground froze. Fruit trees were dormant and leafless. Planted crops were dead until the next year. You had to hunt and fish for food in the winter months. Maybe you had grains stored. In the spring, you planted crops and waited until they were harvestable, still eating meats and the earliest edible berries. The further north you lived the more extreme this reality. Not now. You can be in Canada or Alaska and find fresh bananas from Guatemala in the middle of winter. What's wrong with eating tropical fruits at the north pole? Everything! Eating carbs out of season is a huge NO-NO. It is the exact opposite of nature and sends the wrong signals to every cell of your body. Combine that with extremely bright lighting that extends the short days and you never experience a true winter. Your body would be burning fat for fuel but it still has all the signals of summer, sugars from fruits and long light days. That's how you stay fat. Sweet flavors signal your brain to store fat for winter. Artificial sweeteners do not change this fact. Don't worry. All the sweet stuff will still be there when winter is over. Just do yourself a favor and wait until the appropriate time to eat it. This is about time I switch fats from coconut oil to ghee butter for cooking. I eliminate fruits and reduce vegetables. By December, I'm done with fruits and vegetables for the season.  
  
If you know someone with cancer or anybody that wishes to stay cancer free please pass this report on to them.  
Better health is yours to have,
