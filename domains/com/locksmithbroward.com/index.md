  Lost my keys on a Saturday night during peak hour US1 Locksmith answered their phone and was able to come out. They were professional, friendly, and helpful, and cut me a new key on-the-spot. The price was reasonable and comparatively much more affordable than other companies I've called. Highly recommend !!

  Went for a replacement flip key for my Honda Civic. The owner is very humble & down to earth. They programmed a new key. In the meanwhile, we were offered cold drinks. The new key quality is one mark above. Highly recommended US1 Locksmith Service.
