Protect your critical data with the Zerto platform
--------------------------------------------------

### What is Zerto?

Zerto is a single, simple, and scalable enterprise cloud data management and protection platform. Zerto on OVHcloud enables business and IT leaders, system admins, and DevOps teams to solve challenges with confidence and protect against data loss in virtualized and cloud environments with ease.

**Disaster Recovery with Zerto on OVHcloud**

In the event of a technical incident, applications hosted on either an on-premises data center or an existing OVHcloud Hosted Private Cloud can be switched to the secondary OVHcloud Hosted Private Cloud.

**Deploy Zerto in Just a Few Clicks**

Getting your disaster recovery plan set up with Zerto is as simple as 1-2-3:

1. Deploy a secondary OVHcloud Hosted Private Cloud in a data center different from your first one.
2. Enable Zerto for your Hosted Private Cloud via OVHcloud Manager.
3. Build your virtual protection groups for the desired virtual machines to begin replicating to your new Hosted Private Cloud.

Find out how to quickly deploy Zerto between two OVHcloud Hosted Private Clouds.

**Protect VMs with Virtual Protection Groups (VPG)**

Understanding VPGs and how to effectively manage them is critical for your disaster recovery plan. With VPGs, VMs can be grouped and tiered for protection, helping you achieve consistent recovery points (RPOs) for your grouped machines.

Learn to seamlessly configure a VPG with Zerto on OVHcloud.

### Failover with Confidence and Ease

A failover is the process of recovering your applications and infrastructure to a secondary OVHcloud Hosted Private Cloud when your primary site fails. Failures arise for several reasons, such as ransomware, power or network outages, and natural disasters.

Discover how simple it is to failover your virtual machines when disaster strikes.
