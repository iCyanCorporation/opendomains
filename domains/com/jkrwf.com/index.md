About the fund
--------------

The J.K. Rowling Women’s Fund (JKRWF) offers legal funding support
to individuals and organisations fighting to retain women’s
sex-based rights in the workplace, in public life, and in protected
female spaces. It provides women with the means and confidence to
bring to justice cases that make legal precedents, force policy
change, and make positive contributions to women’s lives in the
future.

What we fund
------------

We fund legal representation for women and organisations who:

* Have lost their livelihoods or are facing tribunals because of
  their expressed beliefs
* Are being forced to comply with unreasonable inclusion policies
  regarding single sex spaces and services, or female-only clubs
  and events
* Are challenging legislation which takes away the freedoms or
  protections women are entitled to
* Don’t have adequate means to bring actions to court or to defend
  themselves

The JKRWF does not hire a lawyer on your behalf, so you must
already have sought legal representation, and have a clear desired
outcome to your case.

How to apply
------------

If this sounds like you, fill out one of the eligibility checklists
below – there’s one for individuals and one for organisations. If
the answer to any of the questions is no, then the Fund is not for
you. If it’s a yes to all of them, you can proceed to the online
application form.

After initial screening, applications go through a rigorous
assessment by the JKRWF board. Awards are at the discretion of the
board, and limited to closely defined legal actions with a clear
goal and timespan. Please note the JKRWF is a private fund, not a
charity or a trust, and does not accept donations.

Who is Pallas Athena?

Pallas Athena
-------------

J.K. Rowling set up the JKRWF in order to empower women as they fight
for their sex-based rights. Her inspiration was Athena, or Pallas, the
Greek goddess of wisdom and war, who believed warfare should only be
used to protect the people and achieve justice. Athena’s symbol,
incorporated into the JKRWF logo, signifies a shield and a woman, which
seemed appropriate to the aims of the fund – giving women the means to
protect themselves against oppression and unfairness.
