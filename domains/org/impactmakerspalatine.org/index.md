Our Mission
-----------

Impact Makers of Palatine is an organization dedicated to community improvement by enhancing the lives of others through volunteer service.

We are a member of the General Federation of Women Clubs, which is an international women's organization that transforms lives each day, not simply with monetary donations, but with hands-on tangible projects that provide immediate impact.

[See recent projects here!](/photo-gallery/)

Impact Makers of Palatine meet every 3rd Wednesday of the month at 7:30 pm at the American Legion Post 690 (122 W Palatine Rd in Palatine).
