Global Timber and Sustainability
--------------------------------

1. Inventory and Assessment:

* Conduct a comprehensive inventory of the forest area to determine the species composition, density, and age distribution of trees.
* Assess the growth rates, regeneration capacity, and ecological characteristics of each wood species to understand their specific requirements for sustainable harvesting.

​

2. Define Logging Zones and Rotation Schedule:

* Divide the forest area into logging zones based on species composition and ecological factors.
* Establish a rotation schedule that ensures each wood species is logged only once every 25 years in each specific area.
* Plan the logging zones and rotation schedule in a way that maintains overall forest diversity and allows sufficient time for regeneration.

​

3. Logging Techniques and Guidelines:

* Implement selective logging techniques that minimize damage to the remaining trees and the forest ecosystem.
* Train and educate loggers about proper felling, cutting, and extraction methods to reduce waste and impact on non-target species.
* Establish guidelines for minimum tree size, quality, and criteria for logging, ensuring that only mature and healthy trees are harvested.

​

4. Monitoring and Control:

* Regularly monitor the logging activities to ensure compliance with the rotation program and sustainable practices.
* Conduct post-harvest assessments to evaluate the impact on the forest, including monitoring the recovery and regeneration of logged areas.
* Implement a system of checks and balances, including independent audits and inspections, to maintain accountability and prevent unauthorised logging.

​

5. Reforestation and Restoration:

* Immediately after logging, initiate reforestation efforts in the harvested areas using appropriate native tree species.
* Implement restoration measures to accelerate natural regeneration processes, such as reducing soil compaction and protecting seedlings from grazing animals.
* Monitor the progress of reforestation and restoration activities to ensure successful recovery of the logged areas.

​

6. Community Engagement and Sustainable Development:

* Involve local communities in the decision-making process and share the benefits of sustainable logging practices.
* Promote sustainable livelihood opportunities for local communities, such as training in sustainable forestry practices, value-added wood processing, and eco-tourism initiatives.
* ​Foster partnerships with local stakeholders, NGOs, and government agencies as IBAMA, and FSC to ensure long-term commitment and support for sustainable forest management.
