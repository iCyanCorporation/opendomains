We were in need of urgent payment processing as our bank suddenly stopped accepting our business. Miguel from Eskimopay was able to set us up within 7 days only.

Over the last 5 years we really had a hard time to find a reliable, honest and trustworthy payment provider. Miguel knows our company for 3 years now and with his new business he has been able to assist our brands tremendously. We can fully recommend him and his services.

We were not so sure about Eskimopay as it is a new company. However, it seems that the guy who runs it has been working for another payment company for many years and he now set up his own business. So far we have been happy with his services, but of course, time will tell how reliable Eskimopay is.
