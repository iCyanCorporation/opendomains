About the Property

Located on the picturesque Gold Coast of Lake Tahoe in the stately Ring Road neighborhoods, this exceptional lakefront offering is quite literally a once in a lifetime trophy property. A true modern-day lakefront lodge reminiscent of the historic estates that once graced the shores of Lake Tahoe. Tucked discreetly away from the main highway and accessed by a meandering private road and gated entry, this impressive estate property sits on 5.21 acres of buildable land and 300 feet of private sandy lake frontage.

Set amidst sprawling green lawns and lush landscaping all around, a recently built 10,524 square foot lakefront home presents the epitome in lakefront living. The setting is quintessential Lake Tahoe with clear turquoise blue waters, waves lapping gently upon the white sand beach, and breathtaking lake and mountain vistas to enjoy in all directions.

Built as a legacy home for generations to come by Loverde Builders in 2017 and designed by acclaimed architect Clare Walton, every aspect has been meticulously crafted to be in harmony with the majestic yet tranquil mountain setting. Nearly every room has a generous lake view and windows positioned to capture the natural light from sunrise to sunset. This timeless home boasts absolute attention to quality and detail in its finishes, materials, stonework, wrapped steel beams, windows, doors, and fixtures, appealing to the most discerning of buyers.

The gracious front entry opens to an inviting living room with soaring vaulted ceilings and spectacular lake views. A neutral and soothing color palette extends throughout the home. A magnificent great room with vaulted ceilings features a large chef’s kitchen with a 6-burner Viking Tuscany oven, spacious Carrera marble countertops with plenty of workspace, a huge center island with counter level seating, an adjacent dining area, and a comfortable family entertainment room. Tall windowed Weiland doors offer the ultimate in indoor/outdoor living.

At the north end of the home positioned in its own wing is the primary suite and spa-like bath, featuring dual custom concrete vanities and a generous shower with a large lakeview porthole window. The stand-alone custom concrete tub with an overhead chandelier and abounding views, invite a meditative soak surrounded by nature.  Outside is a private terrace with a recessed spa. Upstairs one finds an open, light and bright office retreat.

The south wing of the home includes a second primary suite and four additional bedroom suites, all with unique but complimentary décor, stunning lake views and full baths, each with a unique patterned Morrocan tile flooring and shower and tub combination. There is also a carpeted bunk room for kids, a gym with a half bath and outdoor access to the lakeside terrace and a second recessed spa, a massage treatment room, a temperature-controlled wine room, a large 3-car garage with a Tesla charger, and a garage-entry mudroom.

The exterior is designed with summer entertainment and relaxation in mind. A grand Pennsylvania Bluestone patio terrace runs along the lake side of the lengthy home and features two custom recessed spas, a large outdoor dining area, overhead heaters, a pizza oven and barbeque, an indoor/outdoor lounge with a gas fireplace and glass accordian doors, as well as a large outdoor gas firepit. The expansive lawns surrounding the home provide an idyllic and intimate setting for family celebrations, large gatherings, weddings, and events. A brand new pickleball court has recently been added at the top of the property, and the abundant lake amenities include a private 150-foot pier with a boat lift, a second 90-foot shared pier at the southern property line, a beachfront storage cabana with a roof deck, and two additional private mooring buoys.

The home is powered by a 44KW free-standing solar installation as well as a private geothermal system for heating and cooling. An industrial capacity generator and high-speed dedicated fiber optic internet, allow comfortable year-around living. Extensive land planning work has been completed, with substantial verified, allowable coverage available to a new owner, providing the potential to build additional outbuildings, guesthomes gatehouse, or sports courts.

The adjacent vacant lakefront parcel with 1.76 acres, 100' of sandy lake frontage, two buoys, and generous coverage is available for purchase separately.

Nestled in the Sierra Nevada, Lake Tahoe has become a sought after mountain enclave, drawing those from the Bay Area and Southern California with its promise of escape just a short flight away. In winter, the world-class slopes beckon skiers to carve through powdery snow, while summer unveils the lake’s glassy expanse, perfect for boating beneath the warm sun. Year-round, it offers a quiet haven—a place to breathe deeply and let the stillness settle in.

Just ten minutes north in Homewood, the Discovery Land Company has broken ground on its new mountain development, weaving modern elegance into the landscape. Nearby in Truckee, the Ritz Carlton and Martis Camp stand as testaments to the area’s refined allure.

With its pristine air, endless outdoor adventures, and timeless beauty, Lake Tahoe isn’t just a destination—it’s a lifestyle.  Similarly, this iconic Four Ring Road residence is far more than a home; it’s a rare legacy opportunity, offered fully furnished and ready to be enjoyed with family and friends for generations to come.
