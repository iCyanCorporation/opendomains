We are so very pleased with your company. From customer service checking to make sure our system is working well, down to the operators being polite and informative to our owners and staff.

- Dana, Assistant Property Manager

Everything is wonderful. You guys are perfect.

- Dacia, Assistant Manager

We are so happy with your service; we were reluctant to make the switch but we are so happy we did!

- Tenille, Leasing Consultant

Chapel Hill NC

Service is exceptional, I give them an A+. My favorite part is being able to check my email from home and know exactly what is going on.

- Pat, Property Manager

Williamsville NY

Whenever the operators call they are always so nice. They do a marvelous job and they are worth their weight in gold to me. Efficient, polite... if they were located in my town I would come by and bring them a present. They have done a smash up job from day one.

- Gladys, Manager

Lake Jackson, TX

I've done this for 30 years and have never had service, options and results like I have with Apartment Lines, especially for the price!

Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

* [Do you charge extra for?](#do-you-charge-for)

  Extra calls? **No**.

  Extra minutes? **No**.

  Holidays? **Still No**.

  Here’s the bottom line: The rate you receive at the beginning of the month is exactly what you will be charged, no matter how many calls our operators handle from your residents.

  For most accounts, call volume is determined by the size of the community. While rare, if your community experiences an unusually high call volume, we will work with you to negotiate a new rate based on your normal usage.
* [How are calls answered?](#how-are-calls-answered)

  Our basic package combines automated voice messaging with live operators for emergency calls. Residents can leave a voicemail for non-emergency situations or easily reach an operator if necessary.

  This approach helps you efficiently serve residents while filtering out non-urgent calls, reducing unnecessary strain on your staff and minimizing overtime costs.

  For more information about how calls are handled, see [How It Works](/how-it-works/).
* [How can I view and update my account information?](#view-update-account-info)

  When you set up your answering service with Apartment Lines, you’ll have access to your account through our web portal at [my.apartmentlines.com](https://my.apartmentlines.com). There, you can view and update staff contact numbers, on-call rotations, and the instructions our operators follow when answering your calls.
* [Can I see who has called while my phones are forwarded to your service?](#can-i-see-who-has-called-while-my-phones-are-forwarded-to-your-service)

  Yes. You can view call detail records for all calls handled through our system via our web portal.

  These records include the date and time of the call, caller ID name and number, and the action taken by the caller (listened to the main greeting, transferred to voicemail, etc.).
* [Can I monitor emergency calls handled by operators?](#can-i-monitor-emergency-calls-handled-by-operators)

  Yes. Every time a resident speaks with an operator, the call is recorded, and all recordings are accessible via our web portal.

  With our optional *Daily operator report* feature, you’ll receive a summary each morning detailing the previous night's emergency calls.
