Our Family, Feeding Yours
=========================

As a 14th-generation family farm, we are deeply rooted in tradition, community and committed to sustainability. Our mission is to produce the highest quality agricultural products while caring for the land and resources that have supported our family for centuries.

During our off-season our bee products are available for purchase directly on our website. For beef and pork, please email us to inquire about available cuts and to arrange a pickup. All of our bee and meat products are available year-round for scheduled pickups. Additionally, our bee products can be shipped.

Forever & Always
----------------

Minimally Processed

Our family farm is dedicated to producing only the highest quality, minimally processed meat and bee products. Raised with love and care in our local community, we pride ourselves on providing you with wholesome, clean food you can trust

---

Small Family Farm

Just like our animals and bees, our family has deep roots in this community. We take pride in providing the healthiest, most sustainable foods for our families—and yours. You wouldn’t trust your children in a stranger’s hands, so why trust your food to big agriculture?

---

Family Tradition

Head Farmer Chris Bean developed a passion for farming at a young age, learning the trade from his grandfather, who first tilled this land. Today, Chris continues that legacy. A Cornell graduate, he is committed to providing the community with high-quality produce and building lasting relationships as a trusted, recognizable local figure.
