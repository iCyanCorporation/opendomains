Next Game?

I think my soul & wallet are ready for the next Shantae game, hopefully full 3D this time.
Does anybody know if one is in development or something?

Кто есть кто в мире Shantae

В играх серии Shantae (кроме, наверное, первой) персонажи никак не представляются. Чтобы исправить сие досадное недоразумение, я честно спионерил с англоязычной Вики краткую информацию о персонажах игры. Ну и с грехом пополам перевёл текстовину по мере сво

Is This Game Better Than the Others?

Hello.
I've played the other four Shantae games and the only one I liked was Pirate's Curse. The other three were either too outdated or too repetitive to keep me interested. Half Genie Hero especially annoyed me with how repetitive and boring it was. I hear that Seven Sirens is better but I don't want to take the risk with $30 and end up not liking it. How does Seven Sirens hold up to the rest of the series, mainly Pirate's Curse?
Thank you....

The biggest problem of this game is "Seer Dance".

You can see invisible things by using Seer Dance. But you don't know where "invisible things" are because they are INVISIBLE. So you should use Seer Dance at EVERY ROOM of this game. If you are trying 100% run, you should find all invisible things by using Seer Dance at EVERY ROOM. That makes game play so slowly and that is so awful.
I hope at next shantae game, there should be no invisible things to find without any clue provided....

To me this is probably the best Shantae game. On the surface it is a new actual Metroidvania in a vibrant new world, with more customization and collection than before. It's a beautiful game, with the art style of Half-Genie Hero (and thankfully little else about it) and some gorgeous hand-drawn scenes, as well as more voice acting than before.  
  
The best of the Shantae games return; the game is an explorable interconnected world of separate areas, joined across one big map, with new abilities that open areas and paths you couldn't access before, including a variety of magic spells and dance techniques. What's new in Seven Sirens is the efficiency breakdown of these abilities. Spells are as easy to cycle between as ever, but now transformation dances have been somewhat 'replaced' by transformation fusions. These are instantly accessible and don't require any activation or start-up--you simply go to do something that requires a different form, and Shantae turns into it immediately. It is very quick and accessible, essentially seamless, and it makes movement and exploration drastically quicker than before. As a result, just moving around the world feels better than ever before, and the new transformations are all pretty great.  
  
Dances have been tuned, as well. For story reasons I won't spoil, Shantae gains entirely new abilities she can access with her dances. These are, therefore, more notably, screen-wide magical effects that you won't need to access as often as the transformations, so what used to be a tiny little time sink that added up over the game is now a much more managable intrinsic cost to powerful abilities. As part of the new retinue of exploration and combat features, the new dance abilities are also surprisingly versatile, providing uses in hunting secrets, as well as combat, aside from base exploration purposes. They make an excellent addition to our hero's arsenal.  
  
Also new are monster cards, a new collectible that allows you to tune the way you play slightly, gained by fighting enough of any one monster to collect its card. This, like other changes including a little boost to jump height, the speed of transformations as mentioned above, the map with color-coded areas and helpful markers, and other small adjustments make it a joy to play. As I mentioned above, this game is no Half-Genie Hero; it's a true Metroidvania, so fans of the level styled gameplay will find it missing here, but some upgrades that game carried survived.  
  
I have heard before playing that his game was the easiest Shantae. I can't weigh those statements as, at my time of playing, the complete edition with the Definitive version of the game was available and what I got, and I can say as someone who played it that the difficulty was a little harsher than some other Shantae games in places, but with the usual late-game stockpile of gems affording you as much healing and magic recharge as you want. I don't consider any game in the series truly difficult, but I did like the rebalanced difficulty, and it genuinely felt challenging at times and made the use of damage-reduction items and new abilities to ignore fall and spike damage feel good to use. If the difficulty is a worry of yours, I would recommend this game.  
  
I can't call Seven Sirens perfect, for a few reasons; like many online I fell into a long, drastic hunt for the last Gold Nugget I needed for 100%, though luckily any chance at an area being cut off soft-locking you out of 100% was caught by the devs and has an in-game fix, so even if you miss things along the way you can get to 100%, which is nice. There's also a guy who mentions 15 caves, and I only ever found 14 but maybe I;m missing something, who knows.  
  
In any case, this is a very good game and a worthwhile Metroidvania, and I can easily recommend it, especially if you enjoyed the other Shantae titles.

Got it as a birthday gift a couple years ago. I think I played it like 5 or 6 times over, and 100% within the second week or something.  
  
The transformations are super fun, and there seems to be more opportunity to use them all.  
I never found myself using one more or less than the others, except maybe the newt, which I spammed purely out of compulsion.  
  
The humor is still present, the characters are still vibrant, and the bathhouse lady seems to get hotter with every game.  
  
Pirate's Curse is my favorite, this one is a very very close 2nd.  
I love this series, I hope they'll make a next one.
